# SCALESTREAM PRE-CALL SYSTEM™ V3.0 - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
You are working on the V3.0 SCALESTREAM PRE-CALL SYSTEM™ - an advanced sales call analysis and pre-call nurture automation system based on awareness spectrum methodology.

## Core Methodology
- **Awareness Spectrum**: Curious (60%) → General Interest (30%) → Serious (8%) → Convicted (2%)
- **Goal**: Move prospects up 2-3 levels between booking and showing up
- **Three-Layer Segmentation**: Awareness Level (Primary) → Business Context (Secondary) → Psychology (Tertiary)

## Key Principles
1. **Problem Aware** → Need heavy education about opportunity (longest nurture)
2. **Solution Aware** → Need differentiation and proof (medium nurture) 
3. **Product Aware** → Need ROI proof and risk reversal (shortest nurture)

## File Structure Context
- `/prompts/` - Claude prompts for forensic analysis and content generation
- `/sops/` - Standard Operating Procedures for the V3.0 methodology
- `/examples/` - Real examples of analyses, segments, and content
- `/templates/` - Templates for content creation by awareness level
- `/data/` - Client data, transcripts, and analysis results

## AI Instructions

3. Follow the three-layer segmentation approach
4. Focus on moving prospects up the awareness spectrum
