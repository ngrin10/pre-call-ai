# 🚀 START HERE - Master Guide to ScaleStream

**ONE DOCUMENT TO RULE THEM ALL** - This replaces all the confusing start guides.

## 📍 Document Hierarchy & Purpose

### 🔴 Level 1: START HERE (This Document)

**Purpose**: Tell you exactly which document to use when
**When to Use**: ALWAYS start here

### 🟡 Level 2: Core Process Documents

#### For NEW CLIENTS:
1. **Onboarding Form**: `/0-INBOX/new-client-template/COMPLETE-ONBOARDING-FORM.md`
   - **Purpose**: Client fills this out BEFORE discovery call
   - **When**: First touchpoint with client

2. **Discovery Call Guide**: `/0-INBOX/new-client-template/discovery-call-guide.md`
   - **Purpose**: Your script for the 90-minute call
   - **When**: During the discovery call

3. **Workflow Phases**: `/0-INBOX/COMPLETE-WORKFLOW-PHASES.md`
   - **Purpose**: Week-by-week implementation timeline
   - **When**: Planning the 3-week delivery

#### For ANALYSIS:
1. **Forensic Analysis System**: `/prompts/01-forensic-analysis-system.md`
   - **Purpose**: Unified system for all transcript analysis
   - **When**: Choose path based on transcript volume (1-5, 10+, 20+)

2. **Prompt Library**: `/prompts/`
   - **Purpose**: Copy-paste prompts for analysis
   - **When**: During analysis phase

#### For EXAMPLES:
1. **Examples Master**: `/examples/README.md`
   - **Purpose**: Find the right templates and patterns
   - **When**: Before creating any content

### 🔵 Level 3: Reference Documents (Don't Start Here)

These are for specific lookups only:
- `/docs/` folder - Technical details
- Individual SOPs - Specific procedures
- Template libraries - Copy examples

## 🎯 The ACTUAL Process (What to Do)

### Week 0: Pre-Onboarding
1. Send client: `COMPLETE-ONBOARDING-FORM.md`
2. Schedule 90-minute discovery call
3. Review their form responses

### Week 1: Discovery & Collection
**Day 1-2:**
1. Use `discovery-call-guide.md` for the call
2. Create client folder from `/data/clients/template/`
3. Start collecting transcripts (use VA instructions)

**Day 3-5:**
1. Organize transcripts into batches
2. Gather marketing materials using `/03-marketing-materials/` templates
3. Run quality gates

### Week 2: Analysis & Content
**Day 6-8:**
1. Choose analysis path from `/prompts/01-forensic-analysis-system.md`
2. Run forensic analysis (Path A for quick, Path B for batch)
3. Create segment synthesis

**Day 9-10:**
1. Check B2B vs B2C decision (`/docs/03-b2c-vs-b2b.md`)
2. Reference correct examples from `/examples/`
3. Generate content using `/prompts/03-content-generation.md`

### Week 3: Implementation
**Day 11-15:**
1. Import to client's platform
2. Set up automations
3. Test and optimize
4. Train their team

## ❌ Documents to IGNORE/DELETE

These create confusion and should be consolidated:
- Multiple README files saying the same thing
- Duplicate onboarding guides
- Overlapping workflow documents

## ✅ Quick Decision Tree

```
Starting a new client?
→ Send them COMPLETE-ONBOARDING-FORM.md
→ Use discovery-call-guide.md for the call
→ Follow COMPLETE-WORKFLOW-PHASES.md

Running analysis?
→ Use `/prompts/01-forensic-analysis-system.md`
→ Choose path based on volume (A/B/C)
→ Check /examples/ for patterns

Creating content?
→ Determine B2B vs B2C first
→ Find examples in /examples/winning/
→ Apply YouTube psychology appropriately

Lost or confused?
→ Come back to THIS document
```

## 📁 Folder Structure That Matters

```
/
├── START-HERE-MASTER-GUIDE.md (YOU ARE HERE)
├── 0-INBOX/
│   ├── new-client-template/    (Client onboarding)
│   └── COMPLETE-WORKFLOW-PHASES.md
├── prompts/                    (Analysis prompts)
├── examples/                   (Winning patterns)
└── data/clients/              (Client work)
```

## 🔗 Critical Connections

1. **Onboarding Form** → feeds into → **Discovery Call**
2. **Discovery Call** → determines → **B2B vs B2C**
3. **B2B vs B2C** → determines → **Which Examples**
4. **Examples + Analysis** → creates → **Final Content**

## 💡 One Rule to Remember

**When in doubt about which document to use:**
1. Start here
2. Follow the week-by-week process
3. Use the specific document for that phase
4. Ignore everything else
