# 🔄 Analysis to Examples Flow Guide

This document shows exactly how to flow from analysis results to the right examples and psychology.

## 📊 The Flow Process

```
1. ANALYSIS REVEALS → 2. DECISION POINT → 3. EXAMPLE SELECTION → 4. CONTENT CREATION
```

## Step 1: What Analysis Reveals

From `/0-INBOX/` onboarding and analysis:

### Key Data Points Extracted:
- **Average Deal Size**: Determines B2B vs B2C
- **Buyer Psychology**: Emotional vs Logical
- **Awareness Distribution**: % at each level
- **Current Messaging**: What's working/not working

## Step 2: Critical Decision Points

### Decision 1: B2B or B2C?
```
Average Deal Size > $10K? → B2B
Average Deal Size < $10K? → B2C
Gray Area ($5-15K)? → Check decision maker type
```

### Decision 2: Market Sophistication
```
First in market? → Educational focus
Crowded market? → Differentiation focus
Premium position? → Exclusivity focus
```

### Decision 3: Primary Awareness Level
```
60%+ Problem Aware? → Problem education priority
40%+ Solution Aware? → Comparison content priority
20%+ Product Aware? → Urgency/proof priority
```

## Step 3: Example Selection Matrix

### For B2C Campaigns:

| Awareness | Email Examples | Trust Assets | YouTube Psychology |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Problem | `B2C_Confirmation_Email_Problem_Aware.pdf` | Community stories | "Selling to Rich" - mass market |
| Solution | `B2C_Confirmation_Email_Solution_Aware.pdf` | Transformation guides | "Trust Assets" - emotional proof |
| Product | `B2C_Confirmation_Email_Product_Aware.pdf` | Success screenshots | "Pre-call" - urgency creation |

### For B2B Campaigns:

| Awareness | Email Examples | Trust Assets | YouTube Psychology |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Problem | ROI calculators | Industry reports | "Selling to Rich" - executive |
| Solution | Methodology docs | Implementation guides | "Trust Assets" - data proof |
| Product | Case studies | Performance guarantees | "Pre-call" - efficiency focus |
