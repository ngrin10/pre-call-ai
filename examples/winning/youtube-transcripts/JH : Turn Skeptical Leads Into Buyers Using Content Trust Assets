Transcript:
(00:00) all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to today's video my name is Jeremy Haynes and today I'm going to be talking to you about sales assets and Trust assets these are the modern-day techniques that you need to be deploying in your high ticket product or service business in order to convert more of those leads that are on the fence times have changed and the sales assets and the trust assets that get people from one side of a decision to the other have also changed evolved and therefore your business needs to adapt to to those new
(00:31) modern techniques that are probably to make you far more money let's face it when you're selling something for tens of thousands hundreds of thousands or even in one of the examples I'm going to provide you a million plus dollars per person you have to understand that there is obviously going to be a lot of resistance that happens towards the beginning of the sales process that we can slowly chip away at and alleviate and condense down to very large incremental impactful moves to get onto the same page to create that strong
(01:01) relationship to build trust and to get the transaction to occur when you're selling stuff that's cheap there's generally not a lot of these specific tactics that you need to deploy if you're new to the channel welcome in all we do here is talk about hitting million dooll months after you watch this video you will feel enticed to subscribe and turn on that little notification Bell as well as to go and binge a bunch of my other videos because you will be put on to Serious game on this channel this is
(01:26) not one of those little guppy channels where people are talking about how to hit $100,000 a month am measly 1.2 mil a year we're talking about the big dog lessons as an agency owner over the last decade all we have done as a marketing agency is take on clients that we intend on getting to million doll months we've done so just shy of 40 times all the lessons on my channel are just handing down those specific principles tactics strategies and lessons to you through my YouTube page so welcome in without
(01:52) further Ado let's dive in so first of all what is a sales asset what is a trust asset why do I use them hand inand but yet still separate the term it's important to note that in the sales process there are key moments that come and go where we can either create a Monumental amount of trust to close a transaction faster or we miss that opportunity and therefore we dramatically lengthen our sales cycle I'm going to give you an example of this one of the different niches that we operate in as a marketing agency is what
(02:19) we call the raising Capital Niche these are funds syndicates family offices raas uh pretty much anybody that's looking to raise Capital we've even helped companies raise seed rounds through ad ising and we typically generate an accredited investor lead that has x amount of dollars to invest in whatever the specific opportunity is and we connect that lead over to the sales team for the company that's raising the capital as you'd imagine when you're asking for low-end generally 75,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars we have
(02:49) one particular client that raises a million dollar minimum per person that they work with we get 46% of their leads to come through with $5 million or more no exaggeration you and and anticipate there's obviously going to be some friction involved in that sales process it's not as simple as being able to drive a lead over to a vssl or some type of conversion mechanism like a video of some kind that warms the person up enough to get onto a sales call and just say yes there's anywhere from a couple
(03:18) week to generally a couple month sales process in those specific deals as an example of this sometimes it takes upwards of 20 different attempts just to establish contact and I'm talking about like the initial conversation like just to start the convo they have to reach out upwards of 20 times after that initial 20 times happens and they officially get in contact with these very financially well-off leads that were generated there's generally on average about 12 key meetings okay that are probable to take place and these 12
(03:50) key meetings are ranging from something as simple as like maybe a 10 to 15 minute call all the way up to a full-blown presentation of how you can turn that money that you're considering investing into that company into more money in an raia's example where they're literally going to manage the person's money and turn it into more money through time on a very conservative basis in most instances depending on their investment strategy there is an entire analysis of their current Financial strategy and their current
(04:18) investment approach and then what that business is going to do for them in comparison so I mean these meetings on average again they're varied per offer in this case that I'm giving you as examples but I digress the point I'm attempting to make is there's generally 12 key meetings and over this entire duration of time usually it's anywhere from 1 to 6 months before the average person is pulling the trigger the smaller the amount of money generally the shorter the time frame the larger the amount of money typically the longer
(04:45) the time frame so for that raia as an example they managed $23 billion out in Santa Monica California they specifically were generating again 5 million plus dollars per lead 46% of their leads they'd also generate leads all the way up to $100 million plus they had several Executives that had exited from companies for a few billion dollars or a couple hundred million dollars they had leads that were like movie stars politicians uh again just very financially well-off people athletes point I'm attempting to make though is
(05:12) over the course of a good year of just testing and trying to figure out what specifically would work in order to condense the sales cycle and really take advantage of those key moments to just create a Monumental amount of trust there were several different instances where key lessons were learned specific sales assets and Trust assets were created and officially deployed from that point onward that had tremendous impact as shortening sales Cycles so much so that we took those same lessons to Capital raising clients that were
(05:41) raising as an example a minimum of $75,000 all the way up to $900,000 and we'd see the exact same results where we'd see strong shortening of sales Cycles from these specific assets being deployed and then from there we rolled it down to the even smaller deals where they're charging like a couple Grand all the way up to maybe like 50 Grand for some type of high tick offer whether it be a product or service we even went as far as taking this all the way down to the high ticket e-commerce companies
(06:07) that we work with that sells some type of high ticket product like red light therapy infrared beds you know to Red Light panels as an example this lesson that I'm going to articulate to you here today is very applicable simply put across the board uh but again I'll give you examples from like all these different ranges so you can get an idea what might be the most applicable for you and your business in particular so let's start with the biggest the guys that were raising a minimum of a million dollars that they wanted to manage per
(06:32) lead all the way up to that again couple hundred million doll person so across these different meetings one of the very first things that would have to get done before a conversation even occurred is just overwhelming the lead with as many high trust consumables that we could okay and that's where it starts in almost all of these examples I'm going to I'm going to provide we call them high trust consumables okay there's a few things now that can be fake like as an example I'm in this group J full of a
(07:00) bunch of marketers it's like a third party nobody pays for it but it's just only high level people that are a part of it and you have to make a minimum of 10 mil a year in order to be a part of that specific group with like one brand or offer that you're either advertising for or that you own yourself I saw this guy in there the other day he goes in there and he's like hey anybody have a plug to scrub negative trust pilot in Google reviews and like this a perfect segue to the first point I'm trying to
(07:24) make which is like you won't find me sitting here hard flexing Google reviews or trust pilot reviews because they're fake you know like yes there's many many many likely a majority for almost all businesses that are real but like there's services that you can literally pay for to just fake them I have a guy as an example of this that I'm I'm friends with on Facebook okay I don't actually know the guy but like somehow I'm friends with him and I saw him posting all this recently where
(07:51) he was hard flexing people paying him like 15 to 25 Grand to remove and scrub those exact two Services as in example it's like that's a great example of something that's no longer considered a high trust consumable I can't just start off an email sequence or a text thread with hey man like go check out our trust pilot because the consumer's aware that that can be total frivolous okay that's my point like they don't generally trust these third-party platforms anymore there's a lot of
(08:21) people as a great example of this that typically like third parties like not the company itself and their specific trust consumables but like third part data okay and third party data is incredible to leverage but it's you know it obviously varies give or take What specifically you sell third party data in the in the world of uh let's use the let's use the red light therapy business as an example that sells like these red light infrared like tanning booths essentially but they're just full of red
(08:46) light and they also sell these like red light panels so the third party data for them is literally like scientists and labs and like these universities that all were conducting these studies on how red light impacted a wide range of different medical conditions and this isn't FDA approved data you know this isn't like government data this is just again universities third-party Labs scientists uh even random doctors as an example were a part of these funded studies and the company themselves didn't even fund these these were just
(09:18) studies that were already funded by other people they can take those where they find them out in the wild on the internet vet them of course and then use those as some of the initial data that they leverage to people are on the fence third party data is a great example of a high trust consumable for info products it's Reddit like Reddit is a place where people go and talk like there's more people that Google Now when they look for reviews like they'll look for the company name and then they'll type in
(09:44) the word Reddit afterward because that's where real people are having conversations they're not looking for trust pilot you know they're not looking for the BBB you know what I mean like they're looking for real human beings that are not ideally from the company or appear to be influenced by the company to go and consume from like a third party perspective to create that trust that they're looking for it's important to note like your leads are looking to trust you okay like they're looking for
(10:11) reasons to buy or not to buy okay and that's it that's that's the whole point of these like trust and sales assets we're trying to provide them the research okay and this is the main thing that you want to understand that you're attempting to influence by creating these you are providing the research okay otherwise they're just going to go out on their own which isn't bad to be fair like not every business is in some chaotically up position where when you go and Google them they have
(10:35) like horrendous search results that's like a minority of instances by far very small minority of that almost all of you sitting here watching this who are ethical people that have done good business in your life when people go and look you up it's like they're not going to find a bunch of that's what I'm talking about that's a good start you know what I mean but we need to also ensure that we can help thirdparty trust consumables start to rank in the search engines like an ideal example of like a
(11:01) modern tactic to help create this third party trust consumable and both examples I just provided like you could actually step up and be a company that funds A study we have you could technically call it an information product business but it's also like partially a service you know it's kind of half and half and they funded a university to do a study on what the effects of cutting out alcohol were specifically relating to the success of their program so they tied hey I got this system that helps people
(11:28) stop drinking and like these are the claims that we make about what drinking does to people like we want to essentially fund a study that says what's our success rate over what duration of time that prevents people from cutting out alcohol and in addition to that like are our claims true that these people actually experience what we claim they'll experience if they do cut out alcohol which in their world is experiencing Financial upside and a whole range of health benefits this study lasted if I'm not mistaken a full
(11:53) year plus and over the course of this entire study it proved to be very effective but of course it took an entire year for them to generate and develop cuz respectfully to the time they had to follow all the buyers over the course of the entire year really good study results for them there was like a 90 plus per chance that anybody who bought this specific program would cut out alcohol and literally like I think it was 9 point something out of 10 of all the claims that they were making were proven to be accurate true and and
(12:19) like again substantiated which is the most important part now they have this study that they leverage all the time and it's one of the very first things that they send to people as this third party this is done by this University they openly disclosed like yeah we funded it but again like here's the whole process of what it took just to get this study here's how many people they followed here's like the process of how they check in and like conclude to these results they're very transparent
(12:40) about the whole thing and because of that that one all it takes sometimes is just one specific trust in sales asset that gets a majority of people over the fence that helps tremendously especially for the analytical buyers the other thing that I'm talking about here with the red light panels and them pulling all this other thirdparty data that already exists well they get the benefit in their example of having a substantial quantity of data that already is studied uh that can validate and substantiate their claims but more importantly than
(13:07) that can also demonstrate to a buyer like look this isn't frivolous like look how many people who are legitimate are talking about the same claims that we are the information coming from you will sound bias the information coming from a third party will sound great uh another thing that the information product businesses and just anybody really who has any kind of high ticket product or service that has people searching for the company name and the word Reddit is start the Reddit thread like send out a Reddit thread to
(13:32) all of your buyers and give them a place like don't send them trust pilot you know don't send them like Google reviews like again if you're a local company sure having Google reviews and a dominating presence associated with your Google maps location and like you your Google your business section that's incredible and that's good I'm not trying to sit here and say don't in any way shap or form use Google reviews but for like a high ticket product or service it's just a global business that
(13:54) doesn't have like a physical location I mean dude Google reviews frivolous the main thing that's going to be searched and that people are going to look for as a trust and sales asset is a Reddit thread so again like create a Reddit Thread about your business and then send it out to all your customers and say to people hey if you guys don't mind like can you go freely talk about your experience with my product like good bad I'm not going to push you one way or the other but I'd really appreciate it if you could just go in
(14:17) and literally just articulate kind of like you would as if you were leaving a review but doing it in a Reddit thread can you talk about like again what your experience was with us and dude just flood a Reddit thread full of people that are talking highly from a third- party perspective as a consumer of your product cuz here's the here's the crazy thing that happens if you don't proactively do some of these things okay so there's one specific Inner Circle member that we have they're out in Dubai they have an incredible
(14:43) service okay cost about $25,000 and with their specific Service uh there was a long duration of time where there was just consistency in all their kpis and all their statistics cost per call show rates close rates like I mean you just couldn't stop these guys they were a freight train and then all of a sudden they close rate and their show rate started to really get negatively impacted and it was a random time of the year like it wasn't in the middle of Q4 it wasn't like some crazy macro event that was happening that
(15:09) would have prevented people from buying there wasn't even some like change in the overall desire for this specific High ticket service that these guys were offering it was just a random drop in show rate and close rate and when you dug into it like it was really hard for a good I'd say month and a half almost 2 months to try to figure out what specifically was going on they were trying every best practice that you could possibly try and they just weren't really seeing any positive effect from it well one day I don't know I had a
(15:35) hunch I was like do you guys have a Reddit thread by chance that like openly talks from your consumers about what they've experienced with you and they go no like we use trust pilot and I go okay let's look this up real quick so we look up their business name and we look up the word Reddit and like no joke I mean there's like two different Reddit threads that were the first things that ranked and both of them were littered with people who had never even bought their product like the question of both
(15:59) of these Reddit threads was essentially like hey you know I'm in such and such a position I'm considering doing this with this company uh you know does anybody recommend it and again the buyer was looking for trust and the company they didn't provide any research so the consumer went out and did it on their own all they got in response to this specific Reddit thread and I'm not exaggerating were people who did not buy the product that were just course haters that were people who despised the idea that a course could ever help
(16:27) create success for somebody which if you obviously buy courses and you've gotten tremendous success as a result of buying courses like I have it'd be like sitting here demonizing books you know like these are the book bur the the modern day course haters for the ones again like it's there's a huge difference to be fair to these people that hate on course creators that are like legitimate scammers right like I hate on those people too like they those guys shouldn't exist but again like there's
(16:50) an entire industry and Niche of Highly legitimate course creators I have made so much money buying XYZ course and just going out and taking action with it and again making money as a result so it's like yeah there's always going to be like there's shitty books you know and there's tremendous books there's shitty universities there's tremendous universities like you know there's really good restaurants there's really bad restaurants like you can't demonize everything inside of every Niche you get
(17:12) what I mean so anyway I digress however this specific red a thread only was seen by the people who just absolutely hate courses they don't buy them they just hate them they think they're all a scam and I told these guys I was like look at the exact time frame that this Reddit thread ranked in Google versus the the exact correlating time frame that your show rate and your close rate started to take a hit like it's too perfect of a correlation to not put blame on to like let's just take these
(17:40) Reddit threads guys send them off to your hundreds of clients again don't be biased just send it off to them and be like hey we'd appreciate you guys like just sharing your experience in here and out of the hundreds of people they managed to get a little more than 200 people that just openly shared their experience and there were even some to be fair out of their existing buyers that shared what we'd considered like mild or like medium medre experiences like people that would rank something three out of five stars or maybe even
(18:03) four out of five stars but there were hundreds of people again a little more than 200 all together that specifically would have given like a five out of five review in terms of how their experience was articulated in these Reddit threads it took about 2 and 1/2 Weeks Later to see a random uptick in the total quantity of people showing up to calls and buying as a result of again this the statistics actually went above where they previously benchmarked before the dip so it's very important to note like especi in that info product world like
(18:31) that's the modern-day review system at least right now while I'm sitting here talking to you making this video why would you not choose to be proactive about that that correlates directly to that third- party data category of high trust consumables so back to the point I'm attempting to make we want to find for all of the specific products and services that we sell what are our versions of high trust consumables another great example for you to go back to that raising Capital Niche so a lot of these guys especially the ones that
(18:55) have some type of investment opportunity like we have a client in particular and they're main claim is we return a 28% cash on cash return okay the S&P 500 over the last 20 years if I'm not mistaken it's about 11% for its annualized return the heavy weights of the investment world like Warren Buffett as an example openly advocate for putting money into the S&P 500 especially if you're a new investor as a matter of fact Warren Buffett had a bet with a hedge fund manager headed fund managers are notorious for
(19:22) underperforming the S&P 500 and Warren Buffett wanted to prove that point he put a million dollars on the line and he openly said uh look if your hedge fund beats the performance of the S&P I think it was over an entire decade on an annualized return then you know I'll put a million dollars into a charity of your choice and vice versa if you lose the BET then you put a million dollars into a charity on my choice and Warren Buffett won the BET simply put okay so the S&P historically returns about 11% a
(19:45) year at least over the most recent 20 years to my understanding I digress point I'm trying to make for a 28% cash on cash return on an annualized basis I mean that's above and beyond what the S&P returns and the vehicle in which these guys were doing it was like a newer version of real estate rather than doing storage units they were doing RV boat and storage luxury versions of storage unit and they were selling these storage units almost like you'd sell any other piece of real estate so rather
(20:10) than like if you think to yourself of some typical storage unit facility where you might house some stuff yourself you pay like a monthly rent essentially well these guys they'll literally sell the storage unit like a condo as an example like you'll buy it from them you'll pay like a small monthly fee still kind of like an HOA and this on again on average annualized returns is about 28% cash on cash and they're able to get the person their money in and out within about a 2-year duration of time so what they're
(20:36) raising money for is building a new facility so they'll Target a specific location they'll say all right this is the next spot that we're going to build let's go raise some cash now when I initially started working with these guys their goal was to raise about $2 to3 million for one specific property after that went very successful their goal then expanded exponentially to okay we want to raise about $60 million for a handful of properties and that obviously required a little bit of a different
(21:02) approach now here's the point as we started generating leads the minimum lead for this company needed to be an accredited investor and they needed to have a $75,000 investment amount all the way up to $900,000 okay when somebody comes through this specific offer and they hear I mean how how are you going to get me a 28% cash on cash return and you're going to get me my money out in in 2 years I mean that's crazy you know are you sure you're capable of doing that there's so much propaganda in the
(21:29) mind of especially a conservative traditional investor that goes against thinking that that's even possible let alone probable from a company that they saw through a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad or one of the other platforms we run ads on for this company that there's naturally some SK skepticism that has to be handled well this specific company that's raising the capital at this point had 156 individual investors that they had consistently had reinvest into all future projects they had done out of
(21:59) 157 meaning literally all but one person out of everybody that they've historically raised capital from consistently puts money into the next investment opportunity with this company that is incredible that is a I mean literally might be one of the best reinvestment rates that I've ever heard with helping people raise capital I digress though the point I'm trying to make when even just you say that it has to be substantiated the words alone especially the words coming from the company's mouth are meaningless that's
(22:26) how you have to look at it you have to have hard proof you have to have literal data so what did this company do well they did what almost all investors do took the data put it into an Excel sheet and visualized it with a pivot table and demonstrated here is the amount that these people invested here's the timeline on average per person per property that it took to get their money what the money did how long it took to return them the money and then just a simple demonstration of here's how much money they put in here's how much money
(22:53) they got out here's the timeline of how much or I should say how long it took to get that money out and here's the next project that that person invested into here's how much they invested here's how much they got out here's the timeline that it took for them to get that money out just between that first project here's their net here's the second project here's how much they net and they just kept demonstrating that for these 156 people that consistently would reinvest they were demonstrating their
(23:15) Network effect as well they would say okay and this particular guy you know as you could see like he was three projects deep he started to bring in like these other six guys and then those six guys brought in like all these guys you know and now to be clear the need for articulating well why are you now trying to raise outside Capital was also one of their questions so after they built this beautiful video very effective demonstrating literally investor by investor project by project the individual Capital returns with
(23:42) anonymized data to not reveal personal firsthand data from these people uh point I'm trying to make the second question became okay well I mean if you got such a strong reinvestment rate like why wouldn't you just keep doing that like why are you trying to raise outside Capital now from essentially people you're advertising to so they needed to address that this next question was addressed by demonstrating the vision of the company so in the investment World Vision is a very critical piece of the
(24:07) why you're raising Capital component so the founders all teamed up and they did an Incredible video demonstrating their vision and just articulating at one of the properties like look you know we've had so much success with this we want to get ahead of competition like we really want to make sure that we just take advantage of this opportunity in its in its literal fullest form and in order to do so like we had to expand what we were willing to do and like how much Capital we were willing to to to raise and you
(24:32) know how much risk we were essentially willing to take in order to get to the other side of this vision and again in the raising Capital World The Vision I know as silly as it sounds to some of you guys with products and services that are just trying to sell on like a transactional basis the vision is critical in the raising Capital space so anyway that video became very effective and then my point being without going through like literally every single one of them it's just the next thing that would come up in the process of okay
(24:55) well what's that next thing the person needs to know what's the next question that that lead has that's holding them back you know like what is that specific piece of information that we have to figure out next and create a trust asset for in order to convert this individual that's all they thought through in order to come up with a very well-defined set of high trust consumables and then what they did from there is they would sequence it out they would leverage the strategy like the hammer them sequence
(25:18) and they would use this in the emails they would use this in content so the so simply put they would turn the high trust consumables into different variants of consumables they would turn them into emails they would turn them into videos they would turn them into long form videos short form videos they would turn them into random carpet bomb of information that you drop on these people all at once it's a sequence it's an order in which they consume it that makes the trust in sales asset effective I don't want to
(26:12) demonstrate to somebody something that they don't even give a to consume yet I want to specifically show them what's likely top of mind for them in that exact moment and that's what we do in our Inner Circle program as an example we help the member we also do this with our clients of course Define what what the specific path is that the lead is going to go through and what trust asset would best correlate to that specific step that they're in the best marketers on Earth can replicate the sales process that would happen on a
