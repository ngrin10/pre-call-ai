Transcript:
(00:00) ladies and gentlemen welcome to the video my name is Jeremy haes I'm excited to have you here with us we're going to be talking about a fig vssl lessons today the entire channel is dedicated to helping you hit million dooll months if you're already a subscriber welcome back it's always a pleasure to have you here if you're new to the channel consider subscribing after you check out today's video without further Ado let's jump straight into it so over the years one of the greatest conversion mechanisms to deliver information to a potential buyer
(00:24) that hits a sales page a call funnel page a webinar page whatever it is it's the good old vssl now there's many different iterations of vsls out there that you can use I as a marketer who's driven a tremendous amount of Revenue not going to make it up like these other [ __ ] out here but I will tell you this absolutely in the tens of millions of dollars potentially low hundreds of millions of dollars for how much revenue has come as a result of call funnels sales pages webinars that have all had vssl so I feel qualified to give you a
(00:56) tremendous amount of high impact lessons on what you should do in your vssl we'll go through the flow of how a standard vssl can look we'll go through some styles of how a vssl can look that have all converted the best historically I'll go through some of the best practices for selling to a fluent demographics with vsls in addition to that I'll talk about some general public lessons with vsls if you're selling to the masses comparatively to selling to a fluent buyers and there's a tremendous difference between the two we'll get started with the differences between a
(01:26) fluent and general because they're quite different so when you sell Rich folks okay the affluent buyers there is a particular style that you absolutely must follow with your vssl format the length how it comes off the tone in order to get a once again more fluent buyer to be responsive to it ideally the length is about 2 minutes to upwards of 15 minutes in length should not be greater than that the style should be extremely direct should be no fluff should be no added yapping should be all information that they need to know there
(02:04) should be very little lying or potential manipulation give you a great example as much as I love Russell Brunson and everything he's done for the entrepreneur Community out there I absolutely [ __ ] hate that Russell talks about value Stacks okay value Stacks are an absolutely awful principle to follow they're not even FTC compliant okay when you work in businesses that produce million doll months FTC is at the top of your concern list to ensure that you're following their compliance standards that they have and value
(02:34) Stacks do not meet those standards all right what is a value stack for those unaware it's where you say you got a bunch of [ __ ] that comes with the offer you inflate the prices dramatically saying like oh this is 10K this is 3K this is 12K and then I'm going to give you all of that not for any of those prices but I'm going to give it all to you for $11,000 right now it's like don't ever ever do that ever you shouldn't even do that when you're selling to the General Public okay let alone do anything like that for selling to the affluent buyers out there you don't need to do [ __ ] like that when
(03:06) you're selling to rich people it's a very straight forward presentation concise direct authoritative you should have a lot of certainty and confidence in whatever it is that you're saying you're talking and selling to Rich folks and it should be an authentic confidence it's a big difference between somebody saying something in a confident way that still has like a somewhat shaky voice to the foundation comparatively you can hear when somebody's talking about something you could see it in their body
(03:29) language when they know the lessons they know what they're talking about they know what they're selling and again in a very like authentic transparent way the counterparty picks that up so from that perspective comes our next point should be optimize around High trust let me get rid of this silly little value stack okay so again it should be direct you should be certain you should have a lot of authority and it should be an authentic Authority just to be clear okay now again from this next perspective when it comes to selling to Rich folks is also very important if you
(03:59) are going to show your yourself cuz there's two ways you could do it we've had a tremendous amount without exaggeration probably half of our total client base it's hit million dooll months there's been dozens they've done standard presentations that are screen recorded that don't even show themselves at all they don't do what I'm doing to you here where I'm in front of you live in the flesh you get an opportunity to judge me based on body language character environment facial expressions Etc okay that adds a tremendous amount
(04:28) of unspoken communication to what you're doing in your videos okay especially when it comes to your vsls and your sales pages in a majority of instances these are people who don't know you that you're going to be targeting with your paid advertising and driving over to this page that can be both advantageous and it can be a huge disadvantage I know some very highly legitimate business owners out there that are some of the worst spokespersons they're the worst Talking Heads you could possibly put on
(04:53) camera and just melt down like they're great salespeople but when you get a camera in front of them for some reason they just disassociate with who they regularly are and they add a tremendous amount of mental pressure to what they're doing they don't communicate effectively they sound like [ __ ] they come off all like shaky and rigid and timid you know just doesn't look good that type of person or somebody to be fair that just doesn't prefer to be on camera not every business out there is a personal brand or wants to have a
(05:19) specific talking head associated with their business so again more than half about half of our deals it's just standard presentations now these presentations if you do a presentation should not be flashy they should not in any way shape or form be like overdone okay overdesigned is bad in this case uh as shocked as most of you perfectionists out there will be at this specific remark it's true we do a white background with black text or vice versa a black background with white text we will Pepper in some images throughout the presentation if we follow this particular format however it's barely
(05:58) done up at all it's in most most instances a mini weinar and or a mini weinar 2.0 template that we provide to these clients where they'll input their information into that specific flow and all they'll do is record their screen with a voice over on top of it it won't do anything else and again most of these slides and I'm not exaggerating here almost all of these Decks that have been built don't even have like a company logo somewhere in the corner it's just the white background and black text with the screen recording over it now I don't want to make it sound like for some reason you can't design a proper looking
(06:36) deck a proper looking presentation and do that for your screen recording that you flow through but for some reason time and time again every instance that we've tested overdoing the design and just taking it beyond the bare bone basic thing that I just mentioned just flops it doesn't perform as well in comparison to the simple white background black text or black background white text combination don't know why but it's definitely a best practice when it comes to selling to affluent demographics through VSS cells again I feel like if I made some
(07:06) assumptions about it comes off as more trustworthy like take it as an example like this you commonly hear that there's a difference between rich people and wealthy people and how they act and behave it's like most people who want to look rich they overdo it you know they'll wear like really flashy designer clothes that have the logos all over them you know they'll never wear a watch that's made of stainless steel you know they'd want everybody to know know that it's like a solid gold piece with diamonds on it you know some of them buy
(07:34) bust downs as an example they'll never buy any kind of regular car they only buy the cars with the doors that go up something flashy something that let you know I got it I got the money now to be fair there's classy ways of doing that that still signal you've got money but you don't come off like an overly flashy person typically the more flashy you are the less Rich you are whereas the less showy you are the more Rich you are that's the common perception out there in the general public okay and whether true or untrue again that's the general perception of the masses so if you're a
(08:06) fluent demographic subscribes to that same logic simply put sometimes overdone presentations can come off like being the overly flashy rich person who's trying to look more Rich than they are I assume that's why these simpler presentations work as well as they do but time and time again they crush it and they always out compete those ones that are overly done up and by the way this isn't something that I don't test frequently I don't want to be right I want to make money for my clients and for myself so from that perspective I go back and I routinely attempt to prove
(08:37) myself wrong I have not been wrong on this one in a while anyway if you do a presentation don't overdo it simplify it down and there's specific flows that you can use during the second half of this video I'll talk more in detail on the flow of the vsls and how that should look for now I want you to understand the style the format and these overarching perspectives and strategies you need to be implementing in the vssl to get the flow to work at all okay 2 to 10 minutes very direct lot of certainty in your tone lot of authority that you're communicating it's not overly
(09:04) done up you're not using any [ __ ] like the fake value Stacks okay you're not using any fluff you're not using any overly done framing you're not saying you're revealing three [ __ ] secrets okay you're just literally saying this is what I've got and how it can help you and again we'll talk about the flow here in a bit but there's not a lot of dup [ __ ] in it it's very very direct and simple that's why I can be 2 minutes in the first place and still be highly effective Believe It or Not here's a great example in the space that we
(09:30) operate in where we help people raise Capital funds syndicates raas that are managing other people's money you name it things like that these people typically have a 2-minute vsl if that their ad videos are usually 45 seconds to 60 seconds in length it's not a lot that needs to be said beyond the very direct pitch that they have and in the way that they present themselves this is also the next lesson that carries over to when you actually film yourself in a vsl you have to be and match the character that they'd expect you to be and the raising Capital when these guys go out and film their videos they're wearing button Downs they're wearing
(10:01) nice suit jackets they don't look like they were bought at Walmart or Macy's you know like they look like good custom suits quality is what I'm trying to say they also just look exactly like what you'd expect in your head right now somebody highly legitimate that manages Millions to billions of dollars we had a fund that manages $23 billion in AUM or in raia all these people they're like spitting images of one another just slightly different races and ages where all of them wear the exact same button Downs suits you know but it's not overly done it's not like they're wearing ties
(10:32) or bow ties or any weird [ __ ] again just this how you expect all these people to look their office very neutral very neutral colors very neutral art you know plants throughout the office but not overly done uh their desks look like how you'd probably picture them to look if you had an idea in your head of what a fund that manages $23 billion would look like it's probably what you think it is okay and when they film themselves they capture that and therefore they meet the expectations of the people that they're actively attempting to sell to if you can meet the character expectations of
(11:03) what that counterparty is assuming you should look behave and sound like you have a much higher probability of converting that person through your vssl it's a natural subconscious trust that gets created we had a client in 2021 and 2022 that had an offer that was upwards of $40,000 they were attracting investors in their own words and this person would wear a Gucci jumpsuit yes a Gucci jumpsuit one of the ones with all of the crazy designs on it against my recommendation and they were initially shocked when they ran their ads that
(11:38) they were attracting unserious people and they weren't getting the investors that they wanted to attract well upon this person's switching to a more neutral outfit we didn't have to get the person to start wearing suits this is only a $40,000 offer for an alternative investment class nothing that you'd expect you know a hedge fund should dress like or a person on Wall Street would dress like Etc this is just an alternative investment that might be able to make you some cash flow there definitely risk associated with it but
(12:06) the jump the the Gucci jumpsuit was a step too far when we pulled it all the way back to just a black tea with some track pants and some somewhat neutral Nike shoes this overnight targeting the exact same demographic saying the exact same things in the ads literally no difference in messaging just a difference in how the character was presented how that talking head looked overnight there was a substantial difference in a far greater quantity of serious qualified people coming through the funnel a particular client did exceptionally well in terms of total
(12:37) dollars that they generated but again just cuz you are a particular way doesn't mean that you can't be smart enough to dress look and talk a specific way like a chameleon would or one of those fancy octopuses that you've probably seen that camouflages itself in particular ways to maximize them in that environment when you place yourself and here's the best part to most of you sitting here watching this you're already the authentic character that people would expect you to be a lot of you guys like I myself included we don't have to pretend we don't have to adapt
(13:08) we don't have to be a chameleon right but there's a few of you watching this that do have great offers that have a crazy personality type or you're very flamboyant or you're very flashy but you want to attract a very serious person into what you do or maybe you're a very frugal person who doesn't like to spend a lot of money but you have an offer where it would make a lot of sense to be able to demonstrate that you have a good lifestyle associated with whatever it is that your offer has because again some offers imply that you should be living exceptionally well so whether you like
(13:39) having nice cars or having a nice house or just presenting yourself in a particular way again if you're demographic you're attempting to sell to actively assumes that that's what the character should look like that is a very key lesson that you want to apply to your vssl same thing with your direct response ad videos you should look the part okay that's what I want to make clear here and this specific lesson is very important for both the affluent demographics and the general public okay now I want to take a moment and just talk more on the general public lessons
(14:09) this is just everybody besides rich people okay these can typically be a little longer you can do them as short as about 5 to 10 minutes however there's a lot more skepticism that comes from the general public there's a reason that affluent demographics are very financially well off they're accustomed to risk okay know what to look for they've learned to trust their gut they've essentially developed themselves through personal development over an extended duration of time and have applied those lessons live by those lessons simply put they're more probable to take a risk so they don't need as
(14:42) much information they need the right information they need to trust the character who or whoever's communicating it as a business and then again just with the right information presented to them they'll pull the trigger and take an action assuming it's worth their time the general Public's quite different the general public again comes into things with far more skepticism there has to be a lot more trust elements to the vssl itself and typically that starts off with a greater length so if you do 5 to 10 minutes and you attempt to optimize
(15:08) around a high view rate meaning people pressing play and getting to the end of the video at a high rate you're obviously going on a bias towards a shorter length Okay I encourage that you test a shorter video first however if you find that people come through like you know not trusting of your business yet and you're doing something like the hammer them strategy that we talk extensively about on this channel to help pre-frame and warm people up prior a call occurring or prior to that key communication or event occurring like as
(15:33) a webinar presentation as another example then you need to look at the vssl and potentially lengthen it if you're selling more to the masses okay the masses simply put they just require more information I would like to put a Max limmit here of believe it or not 60 minutes we have run a high quantity of mass Market offers that have hit million doll months and surprisingly you can run a vssl all the way up to 60 minutes it's almost in some instances like an entire webinar that you're just placing into to a vssl slot on a sales page on a call
(16:04) funnel page you know Etc wherever you're going to place it the max those should be about 60 minutes we've seen a lot of diminishing view rates and retention statistics for anything longer than 60 Minutes generally and as again surprising as it sounds when you look at the play rate and retention metrics if there is a particular video assuming that this is time and this represents the retention okay on both both of these here you should understand that the shorter Ones Will typically have a bias towards a retention graph that looks
(16:37) something like this yeah you have a drop off but it's nothing significant on these 60-minute videos or anything that's longer essentially than that 10 I'd say about 20ish minute mark it'll start to look more like this where you get a pretty significant drop off at the beginning but then it flattens out and you get a lot of retention through these later stages of the vssl and that helps bring in a much better framed person in terms of expectations you might see in terms of quantity of people that make it to this like retention part where you
(17:07) they just stick throughout the remainder of the video no matter the length below 60 Minutes this will typically be about 10% or less of the total viewers that originated in press play in the first place human beings whether they're affluent or in the general public all optimize around the same general evolutionary principles that are within all of us as soon as somebody feels that they have have understood something and they can determine this is for me this is not for me they take the action or they Le there's a big misconception when
(17:37) you're making vsls and again whether it's to affluent demographics or the general public it applies to all of this where the Assumption as a business is well they are going to watch the entirety of the vssl and that's what I want as a business and that is the dumbest thing ever because again it neglects how people are you shouldn't expect that somebody is going to watch 100% of your vssl and then show up on your sales call or to your webinar framed with 100% of the information retaining 100% of the information that they consumed even if they did somehow watch 100% of it that's just not the
(18:13) case that's not how it works in reality that's why I say it's dumb how it actually works is when you see these drop offs where people start to leave at these different stages yes at the very beginning if you see a significant drop off okay where it looks very steep that means means that the beginning of your vssl your opening hook can change I absolutely agree if you have a tremendous drop okay same graph retention in time where it looks more like this this needs fixed that opening area has to be redone I don't disagree
(18:43) with that at all but what I want to be clear of is it if it looks more like this whether it's short or long and you get that nice descending gradual decline that's the natural order of how humans behave people are learning about what your offer can do for them and as soon as they get that conclusion point where it's like Yep this is for me they're going to go apply they're going to continue the process from there or they're going to opt in whatever it is you're optimizing for versus the opposite is also true if they watch to a
(19:07) certain point and they just say I don't think this is for me they just leave they not going to stick around for the whole thing where you might have something else towards the end that could have flipped them and got them to convert they just [ __ ] leave again they're optimizing with speed and urgency around trying to conclude if it's for them or not and almost all instances when you drive somebody from any any source of traffic whether it's organic or paid sure with Organic there might be a slight bias and skew to that
(19:31) person caring more and maybe doing a little more research spending a little more time with consuming these vssl assets PID traffic is totally different even if they're a warm audience they are in most instances Facebook Instagram Tik Tok LinkedIn sometimes even YouTube if you're doing interest targeting vice versa for any Google AdWords placement they're open to suggestion simply put they're scrolling for entertainment or for education or for whatever purpose on that news feed and all of a sudden your ad interjects into their day and it spikes enough curiosity for them to go
(20:01) to the following page which is where this vssl is placed and again if you have a decent play rate which means out of everybody that hits the page you have a high quantity of people above 50% that press play on your video great now they've started the process of that exact evolutionary trait I just described they're now attempting to figure out okay can I sell myself more that this is for me or can I sell myself that no this is not for me and I'm going to leave and save my time the outcome in both of those instances is I'm here to figure if it's for me or not okay that's
(20:30) essentially the intention of the vssl and its ultimate finest Source reason it's there in the first place okay to get more people to identify it's for them and to get more people to therefore take the action you're optimizing for all right again it's okay that people leave if too many people leave in a very short duration of time that's a different issue you should change whatever that issue is okay gradual graph totally cool steep decline change it simple enough right let's continue on point I'm attempting to make here with
(20:56) the general public lessons Okay a lot more skeptic ISM so therefore there's a lot more trust assets that have to be added okay and when you look at trust assets these are things like testimonials uh these are again like the character themselves should typically be more empathetic there's different values that these demographics hold right richer people have different values in most instances although yes I don't want to make it sound like they're completely different people I do want to make clear that there's a difference in values simply put in a majority of cases
(21:27) between affluent people and the General Public the values of the general public when you really look at how that should apply into a vssl and I use this trust assets example these should be highly believable testimonials uh these should not be like as an example one of the most believable places you can capture a testimonial from is where you got the testimonial if that was in the form of a video great if that was in the form of like a screenshot from a social platform where your community and clients hang out great if that was in the form of an email that they sent you great if they
(21:58) unfortunately pulled it to you over the phone and you didn't record that phone call and then you retype that testimonial with a fancy little photo of them and like their first name and their last name initial that's not going to be believable okay you have to have trust assets that are highly believable you also in most instances have to communicate in a more empathetic way whereas you can be a lot more direct to affluent people if you were as direct to the general public you're going to be perceived as an [ __ ] in almost all instances if the regular people out
(22:28) there got a hold of all of my videos as an example I'm at a very high probability going to be perceived as a dick as an [ __ ] okay and that's not intentional on my part I typically just communicate in a very direct fashion which again offends the general public comparatively so I say this under this trust assets umbrella because that same character lesson I was talking about prior with the affluent demographic applies here but in slightly different ways the communication style changes how you are as a character changes the environment can change um there's still a lot of important lessons to consider
(23:02) with what makes the general public consider something like highly trustworthy so let's talk about the presentations and just the character sitting there talking and doing like a talking head style vssl like this here as a good use case okay it has to be overly designed for the general public if you did the simpler thing with the general public where you did white background black text black background white text combinations no company logos basic photos with like no borders again like very minimal Des like you would do to affluent demographics that is going
(23:31) to cause insane levels of skepticism and distrust amongst the general public they are going to look at what you're doing as a scam almost immediately okay treat it like when you're talking to the general public by default they're looking at what you're saying with skepticism they're looking at what you're saying as this is a scam and there's a very low probability that they're open to being sold on it they're essentially coming in like not sold like no this isn't for me but for some reason they still consume the information to
(24:01) flip okay they still want the potential result you're going to sell but they approach it from a perspective of this is probably a scam I probably shouldn't trust this company there's just a lot of beliefs that are shared amongst the general public that they haven't deconditioned yet again rich people are all evil companies are all evil some of them don't even think capitalism is good as an example you know you see what I'm saying so anyway my point is these trust assets the communication Styles the way you present things Act designing things extremely well and trying to be like
(24:31) over the top with your presentations that you stylize and again like Design Elements being cared for trust assets like testimonials being used that are highly believable uh but again not turned into testimonials that don't look believable it's totally cool to screenshot or share a video from where it was actually captured instead of redoing it cuz again we're trying to optimize around believability when we talk and sell to the general public which is all the presentation needs to be focused on as it's found ation there cannot be any overzealous claims that
(25:02) are made with affluent demographics they should be very reasonable claims um cuz again these people you like in no way Sher performs you be attempting to fool affluent people with the general public though like I know this kind of sounds a little ridiculous but believe it or not the more like overzealous the claim is typically the better it performs and I I know that might sound a little backwards considering well okay you just said the general public needs a lot of trust assets and you'd likely think therefore you should be extremely conservative about any claims that you make towards
(25:32) your product or your service that you offer that's not really the case with the general public believe it or not any kind of claim should actually be done to the greatest compliant extent that you can take it okay whereas again with influent demographics just to reiterate you should be extremely conservative with any claims that you make they should be undershot rather than overshot okay a good example of this and again this might sound a little ridiculous like I always talk my Channel about hitting million dollar months okay in my agency the reality is for us to get paid
(26:04) $100,000 off of a 10% net rev share trackable back to us I have to net those companies we work with a million dollars a month that sounds infinitely more ridiculous to a rich person in comparison to saying we can take you to gross million doll months the all the people out there doing a good couple hundred grand a month they know within them it's possible to hit a gross million dollar month but if you tell them the game I really play is taking businesses to a million a month net that we work with as an agency and that's our
(26:33) goal that's our purpose that's our intention of what we try to set out and do when we work as an agency that is an overzealous promise affluent demographics it would tune right out but again it's very believable to an affluent demographic okay I can hit million dollar month's gross for sure I can optimize around profit and probably net out a good couple hundred grand again the more conservative I can be with a fluent demographics the better the more overzealous I can be but it Still's got to be believable okay like my claim obviously in my whole Channel Channel not dedicated to the general public quite the opposite I actively
(27:02) attempt to deter the general public from my videos okay I do not want them watching my videos cuz again it's not built for them I want to be very clear when I say this it has to be believable for whatever your overzealous claim is okay you have to optimize around some but is like the biggest and most compliant Within Reach outcome that your product or service can help achieve okay anyway I digress trust believability handling the skepticism communicating and very like empathetic iCal ways not coming off too direct not being too assertive not speaking with too much
(27:35) authentic Authority because again somebody who's coming off as like highly authoritative highly certain highly believable for what they do and what they sell might believe it or not as crazy as it sounds create more skepticism in the general public if you do a presentation it should be designed well and just to be clear on this this is very important to note with the affluent demographics it should not be overly designed okay that value point that I made with the fluent demographics and absolutely under no circumstances do it that still applies for the general public as well you should not be doing
(28:06) those stupid value Stacks that are non-compliant and that just again make people think you're full of [ __ ] okay however a nice believable discount like maybe you offer it normally at $5,000 and you're going to sell it for $3,500 that's a good believable discount okay some real scarcity general public does extremely well with real scarcity okay affluent people do too to be fair but you generally don't need to leverage any kind of real scarcity with the affluent demographic because if they care about doing whatever it is that you're selling they'll take the action they're much more biased towards action and taking
(28:38) risk general public they need a reason to move okay it's over if I'm not mistaken here I think it's like 73% of the United States working classes paycheck to paycheck it's a lot of people that are again just moving from one check to the next to the next and just surviving there's not a lot of people the top 5% of income earners in the United States is 880,000 so you want to be in the top 5% of the United States about $80 something, you need to make a year to be in the top 5% okay give or take where you live that can be great money but you know as we all know in major cities that's awful
(29:08) money and I I'm sure as well as you would cry if we only made $80,000 a year anyway not the point of what I'm trying to say the point of what I'm trying to say is that they have other things that they typically need to spend money on and a lot of the working class like a lot of the general public they like to save rather than earn so when they have something that they want to spend money on there's usually something that they've been actively saving for for a long duration of time I'll give you a great example I had one point had a golden retriever for about 48 hours and
(29:38) I'm just apparently not a golden retriever guy because I have wiener dogs and my poor little wiener dogs were absolutely petrified by this golden retriever puppy that we bought when it was just trying to do basic things like play with them my little dogs were petrified so I ended up after I bought this golden retriever about it literal day after I had ownership of it called the uh pet place that I bought it from and I said hey uh look I am so sorry I'm not trying to return the dog and get my money back that's not what this is about
(30:03) my poor little dogs I already have are just over the top about this golden retriever being around them I've unfortunately got to give this thing back is there anything that you could do to be able to take this dog back again I'm not looking for the money and they had said well no I mean you know we won't be able to like accept the dog back however there was a couple that was saving for this dog for several months let me call them and see if they're open and coming and picking it up and I was like oh that would be tremendous thank you so much much so at the time I'm living in this 12,000 ft house if you
(30:32) want to call it that on 5 Acres you know it's like double gated to get into it I have who knows how many cars parked out front that are a couple hundred, each you know and this uh this couple pulls up to the house to get this Golden Retriever come come to find out there like a waiter and waitress couple and they had saved up in their own words for like 7 months to buy this $3,000 Golden Retriever and you I just at this point literally gave it to them I didn't want any cash I didn't want any money I just wanted my poor little weener dogs to
(31:03) feel safe again you know not not feel attacked and on edge the poor little guys so anyway I give him the dog you know we're kind of going back and forth and to me you know as an affluent person I was shocked I was like you guys saved for [ __ ] that many months to buy this dog like I mean I can't even imagine all the other things they probably put off I mean that's more than half a year to save for a singular $3,000 purchase uh so anyway the perspective I'm trying to provide you here with with this specific example is this is how most of the general public is is they're Savers not
(31:33) earners and there's generally something that they're already actively saving for that they have the money set aside again for a very specific use case and if whatever it is that your selling comes up and can somehow take more priority over what they've been saving for that's usually where the money's going to come from and or credit okay most of fluent demographics when leveraging credit are going to purchase that item that product that service and then obviously pay off the balance in full sometimes literally later that day or within a week or obviously by the end of the credit card
(32:05) billing cycle uh that's true in most instances for the general public when they buy you know things that are more within their means but if whatever it is that you're selling through your vssl is going to stretch them a little bit I want you to just remember this simple thing when you're crafting the vssl and considering like what you're selling against you're selling against the thing that they've been saving for or you're selling against potentially them going into debt and pay paying credit card
(32:29) interest for whatever it is that they're going to purchase from you if it's several thousand okay so they're going to use that savings is what I'm trying to say and then continue saving for the thing they've had their focus on and or they're going to be using credit in some instances they'll even leverage multiple payment uh payment types um I also want to be clear in saying that they might not always make the purchase then and there your sales Cycles are either impulsive or generally a little longer
(32:53) because again there's very specific dates where they get paid that will enable them to then purchase whatever it is that you're selling so point I'm trying to make these things can be strategically leveraged inside of your vsl you can empathetically acknowledge these different points such as hey guys like with this product that I'm selling I totally understand that you might have had things that you've been saving for or that you might you know go into a little bit of credit debt in order to purchase this but let me explain why
(33:17) that makes sense to do and then again like just using that as a transition Point into some objection handling or into covering some features that like really make whatever it is that you're selling as a product or service a critical purchase for that individual these could be tremendous leverage points in order to convert that individual okay now I want to go through the flow here of what a vssl should look like and I have an entire vssl uh sop crafted that I'm actually going to go through with you right here on this presentation the one thing I want to point out about this sop is that it has
(33:47) a few different links that you are not going to be able to go through uh here within this video that you need to be a student of mine to have access to those links include up to a dozen different vssl examples that are for a fluent and for the general public that are both short and long that you could watch in its entirety so if you're one of my inner circle members if you're one of my master internet marketing students if you're one of my clients uh if you don't already have this sop just shoot me a DM
(34:13) on whatever platform we communicate and I'll make sure you get access to it go into the group chat of your respective course or community that you have access to through me and you'll also find it there you just type in mastering vsls and you'll see it in the search history if you are just somebody sitting here watching this on YouTube I want to be very clear I'm going to go through this sop in its entirety besides those examples and in addition to that I also have the templated versions of the mini
(34:38) webinar and the mini webinar 2.0 that are also only for the people who pay me money I'm not going to be going through those here either I would consider if you're rich trying to get a hell of a lot richer to join into my inner circle offer twice a month one-on-one calls we can Create and Craft and review vsls all my ad strategies continuously optimize you ma

(36:23) jump into what the flow of a vssl should look like all right so the flow of a v vsl uh first of all again sop here and we're going to go through it in detail uh let's get started with how vssl should open up the vssl opener is the hook okay the hook should be articulated in a way where it's what you can specifically help them with so as an example let's say I use my master internet marketing program it start off with hey guys my name is Jeremy Haynes I'm going to help you master internet marketing if you're looking to become more certain as a digital marketer I'm your guy pay attention to this vssl I'll cover all the details of the program
(36:56) it's like it starts off with what the intention of watching the video is it starts off with what you're going to do for the counterparty that's going to spend time with you there a lot of the times when you see like a significant drop at the beginning of a vssl and People Press Play and just immediately leave it's cuz your opener sucks and you're not immediately telling people why they should stick around that's usually as simple as it needs to be if you do it any differently which we've done many times over in different ways we typically always find ourselves reverting back to these openers whether
(37:27) it's the mini weinar the mini webinar 2.0 or just a standard vssl presentation like we're covering here today it needs to be optimized towards this outcome here's what I can do for you okay in a very direct and concise way keep in mind again if you're selling to the general public should not be as direct you can be a little more lengthy with your explanation of what you're there to do for individuals with the affluent demographic short direct punctual authoritative certain to the point okay now you then roll right away into here's
(37:56) why I can help you with that so when you build a vsl okay and you're structuring the flow it's pretty simple how it works you just want to think of like a normal sales conversation how a conversation would work so if I say hey here's what I can do for you and I don't immediately follow it up with here's why I can be the person that does that for you there's this big gap that happens mentally where you just skipped right over what the person actually wants to know next the perfect vssl ideally is just a flow like a normal sales
(38:28) conversation but done without the counterparty communicating with you that's all it really is so if I start off with here's what I can do to help you out and I don't follow it up with and here's why I can be the person to help you with that or here's why my company can help you do that you will have a tremendous Gap and here's how this works if you have a question that's left unanswered okay when you're in a conversation try to talk to somebody about something and when you can tell they have a question just keep talking and don't let them ask the question when you finally get done talking what what
(38:58) will happen will be like magic to prove the point I'm trying to make it'll be as if they didn't hear a single word you said past the point when their question came up that was left unanswered as soon as you get done talking they'll bring up the question and you'll be like dude that was like 10% through what I was explaining so you didn't even hear the other 90% of what I said that happens all the time when people make vssl that's a big reason that people drop off they had something that was left unanswered so they leave because you didn't answer it so you have to be really good at guessing here again just
(39:27) like a norm conversation I'm going to give you some information here's most probable to be what I think you need to know next if I had a real conversation with you in real life about this same thing okay so again just to reiterate hey here's what I can do for you my name is Jeremy Hayes I can help you master internet marketing I'm going to put you into a 7we live class that'll get you all the certainty you need all the strategies you need all the tactics you need all the latest softwares all the best practices to help you become a
(39:52) confident digital marketer here's why I can help you do that and then I'm going to start going through my decade of expertise my decade of spending a trem we spend a couple million dollars a month at ad spend nowadays you know I don't even know how much money I've spent over 10 full years on ad spend I don't even know the quantity of people that we've driven to landing pages I don't know my overall conversion metrics across every [ __ ] funnel I've ever ran I don't know the amount of total revenue we've generated nor will I make any of that up what I do know is a lot
(40:22) of assumptive numbers for those things based on the general amount of money we've spent the general amount amount of money we've made and we have a fuckload of proof to back it all up I can show you a tremendous amount of examples so my point being at that step in particular for step two of why I can be the person to help them I'm going to be going through that kind of information okay Product Company Service Company doesn't matter you follow the flow works every time okay so under this particular step when you're talking about why you can help somebody now that you
(40:50) understand why this has to be the followup to the first step we're going to share any kind of like background information on ourselves and our company that gives us that expertise to solve that problem or get that outcome that we're helping the person with this is also an opportunity to kind of strategically plant uh you know objection handlers you know where if there's something that comes up such as like a trust issue or something that comes up with like a money issue uh and why somebody would justify spending
(41:15) whatever they're going to spend on your stuff this is where you can say like you know over the last 10 years we've had 2,17 high ticket clients that have converted with us that have spent at least $55,000 now over that entire period of time we've had a. 57% dispute and refund rate which means that 99.
(41:40) 4 something per of all customers that have ever transacted with us and spent $5,000 at the minimum have been extremely happy as a result of working with us and giving us that money on the other side of whatever result or service we are helping that person with we and then again just transition to experience you see what I mean it's like and by the way that's real okay point I'm trying to make here when you talk about the wise it's not just one of those [ __ ] like here here's a little bit about who I am you know where you just talk about like utter [ __ ] that doesn't actually
(42:02) help sell the person on why you can be the one to do it it's got to be like a legitimate answer you know very rarely in a I'll give you a perfect example like very rarely in a real life conversation will somebody say hey here's what I can do for you and then you follow it up with I'm the right person to help because I've been featured in Forbes Fox News Entrepreneur magazine it's like this is not a normal conversation you know these are not the things in which you'd bring up as Flex Points and real life to like get somebody to become believable about the fact that you're the right company or
(42:32) person to help them with whatever it is that you sell you get what I mean but like a lot of the times after somebody says like here's what I can do for you they follow it up with the most utter [ __ ] ever that that nobody actually would ever say in real life like nobody would actually care about that in real life nobody would respond positively to that in real life if that was the tactic that you use you get what I mean it's like the why part should be a genuine reason for why you are legitimate or a
(42:56) set of genuine reasons that are real you know what I mean okay anyway after you get through the first two the what and the why then you move into selling them on more of like the bigger picture about whatever it is more of like the industry or the main like Market drivers for buying motives this is essentially an opportunity and its finest form just to talk about buying motives across the board okay so as most of you know who have watched my channel uh we've talked about this concept called the majority hook okay so when you go out there and
(43:25) you look at the reasons that people buy more commonly than any other reason there's typically like one bulk driver for like why somebody purchases something from your business and then from there it like transcends down to these smaller and smaller reasons for why people are going to do business with you and like what their specific purchasing motives are okay and these reasons diminish in quantity of people that identify with them you know as you get like smaller and smaller into minority hooks okay there might be like very specific use cases that somebody
(43:55) purchases uh window tin you know most people as an example are going to want to do it to reduce sun glare uh reduce heat in their vehicle some people do it to look cool uh some people do it to commit crimes you see what I mean it's like well there's a good probability that as an example you know committing crimes is going to be a minority hook uh there's a minority chance that somebody's going to do it just to look cool you know there's probably a good majority of people that are going to do it for the two main drivers okay which again are probably to reduce heat and
(44:29) overall reduce glare okay different motives but collectively they make up the market of motives so when you get to this point in the presentation where you're selling the bigger picture what you're really doing here is is you're just peppering on all the reasons that people are actually going to purchase from your business why does somebody regularly do business with you and ideally you Cascade down the list from majority reason to Second majority reason to minority minority minority minority until you get into these like
(44:54) little small kind of chip away interests buying motives that you might not even need to talk about to be fair like if I'm selling window 10 I'm not going to openly Market the fact that it's easier to go and commit crime in a car that's heavily tinted you get what I mean it's like I don't know I'm not going to Market that it doesn't make sense to Market there's certain hooks that just honestly make no sense at all for you to put into your ad creatives to your vsls Etc but there are a majority of the
(45:17) hooks that are the dominating buying motives that you should be talking about right here okay now this gives you an opportunity to do several things when you're talking about these different buying motives gives you an opportunity to be rather elaborate in your explanations for what and why the reasons are so it's like what the reason is why people who have that Reason by you see and you could be elaborate in these explanations by explaining like whatever that specific dominating factor is uh or set of dominating factors this is generally multiple slides or a pretty
(45:49) decent chunk of your presentation the first two steps that you're going to flow to the what I can do for you and why it makes sense for me to be the company or person that can do it that can be rather short you know that might be like a minute sometimes far less this section is typically a good chunk okay cuz again you're coming up with why somebody's actually going to do business with you and you're talking about those specific individual reasons and highlighting them here again just like you would in a real life conversation after you say here's what I can do here's why I'm the company you could trust to do it from there usually what
(46:19) would happen in a sales call would be let me ask what's your specific reason we're talking right now and they would say know I'm here because I'm dealing with this and I think that you guys might be able to help and then you're going to say oh yeah do we get people like that all the time that come through here for that exact reason um here's how we help that specific type of person that's what you're doing here on step three okay then we move on to step four step four is where you present your actual offer this is where you are going to talk about whatever it is that you
(46:42) want to sell to that individual I get questions on this step all the time like oh Jeremy I got multiple offers I got plenty of different [ __ ] I could sell them sell whatever is going to make you the most money that the most people that you targeted to watch this video are going to buy okay you can pepper in here if you want yeah we got other things by the way for some kind of Fringe situations that might occur where we've got things for a little less money and things for a lot more money too that we can do for people but the main thing I'm talking to you about here today is X
(47:09) okay and you plug the main offer that you want to be selling to people through this vsl to those of you that have single offers you know you don't subscribe to that specific advice of needing a pepper in multiple offers great that's a majority of You by the way just make sure for the minority of you that have multiple things that you do routinely sell talk about the main thing that you actually want to sell the most that's the most important thing to Pepper in here okay so I also get this so frequently and people still argue
(47:36) with me about it okay I I personally believe it's inarguable and you might have a different belief but again let's talk about it in the comments okay I think you should always say the price okay the counterargument to that is usually well if I say the price I'm not going to get as many calls or I'm not going to get as many registrants or people are going to leave well that's the point of saying the price okay I want people to know what it cost because I want more sales calls to come through that are qualified okay a lot of the
(48:07) people on the counterargument side they say well Jeremy I've got people that come through my application who didn't know the price that when I say the price on the call yeah they're shocked by it that person would have otherwise leaved and I would have never had that sales call but I still sold him anyway hey that's great and that might be true okay but in my world here's what I do when I say the price in my vs Sals I am getting a more qualified person through my application onto that scheduler that are going to be talking to the sales team I
(48:37) am getting more qualified people who know the price to hit my pixel send that data back to the ad Channel and the ad Channel AI optimizes around find finding more of that person the more highly qualified people I get the easier it is for my advertising algorithm AI to go find more people people just like that person who's highly qualified I Through Time Out compete you every time in getting highly qualified people through my funnel because I went through that very short-term window of spending to condition my pixel you never make it through that conditioning window you always defer to little short-term
(49:18) tactics like that one as an example where you don't say the price so you get more calls those calls don't end up being qualified calls you sit there and then [ __ ] that you don't get only qualified calls and you waste your closer time and you don't make as much money as my clients will and again you know what you need to do but you never [ __ ] do it because you always convince yourself of your counterargument that you should be allowing more sales calls through that are technically unqualified or unaware of the price they show up and they're like dude I wish you would have told me that up front I never would have even
(49:47) [ __ ] shown up for this call cuz I can't afford that I won't go into debt over that Etc versus the people I send through to the closing teams or that I send to a webinar dude they're fully aware of the price and all the value that follows me saying the price justifies why it costs that much just like what would happen in a sales conversation you don't have a sales conversation and don't talk about price that's not how sales works okay so again I'm just following what would happen in real life and doing it and capturing it in the form of a vssl just without the
(50:15) counterparties communication you consistently try to I need more sales calls you know I don't care if they know the price I want more calls you never make it through the conditioning window as a result so you never get to heaven you never get to the glory land where only qualified highly qualified people come through that funnel that are aware of the price get framed like crazy going through my hammer thead strategy and then show up to the sales calls ready to buy layup deals I turn sales people into cashiers okay I digress point I'm trying
(50:39) to make I always State the price up FR always I always will I'm going to explain what's included I'm going to just reiterate under no circumstances do that stupid value stack that's non-compliant you'll never find me doing that that is silly it should never be done it's not FTC compliant it makes you look silly okay cuz it again nobody believes it nobody's sitting there like oh that's $10,000 oh that one's that one's $5,000 that one's $20,000 oh my God and you're going to give it to me all for $1,000 oh my God that's there's not a [ __ ] person on Earth who sits
(51:11) there and watches a video and does that nobody does that you know what they do instead they sit there and they're like why is he saying that's 10,000 so he's valuing this offer at he's trying to say this is $50,000 and he's going to sell it to me for5 the [ __ ] you know that's their real reaction they're super confused turned off by it and they're like what the [ __ ] is this this guy a why is this guy lying like this that's what they actually say just so you understand non- exaggerated characterizations by the way okay anyway after we make our offer after we State
(51:39) the price okay after we explain what comes with it we're going to do some objection handling again replicating a real life sales process so when we go through handling objections we're going to make sure that we pepper it in with a nice transition slide so right when we say our offer we're going to have a little transitional moment where we say and by the way I think this is a perfect offer let me go through why boom and then I transition to my objections whatever my most common objections are and by the way this could also be
(52:03) another bulk of the presentation where it's like technically step three where I'm explaining the buying motives and the reasons of purchase then I make my offer that can typically be a little short and then again this fifth step here where I go through objections depending on how many objections I want to sit there and handle this could be another good bulk of your presentation and the objections should be longer there should be more objections handled when selling to the general public the objections that you handle for the affluent should be their real objections
(52:28) the hard-hitting ones that they're actually going to want to know not some frivolous [ __ ] that you make up that you think people want to know these should be the real reasons that somebody's going to say I want to do business with you I don't want to do business with you because of this question being answered a particular way the real reasons when you're selling to the affluent keep in mind what I said with that evolutionary characteristic they're trying to find out if it's worth their time okay so if you handle an
(52:55) objection that they actually have there have a much higher probability to prioritize showing up and buying you already handled it on the vssl if you don't handle it on the vssl you have a higher probability to have a [ __ ] show rate you have a higher probability to get more people to leave or not book at all cuz they don't think it's for them cuz you didn't answer the key question they had that was holding them back from doing business with you this is the place to have the sales conversation okay this is where you handle the real objections that are coming up in your sales process yes you might be making
(53:25) some assumptions I'm not saying you're not going to you're not going to make some assumptions about what the counterparty has going on in their head for why they might not buy but you need to pull real data from real sales calls from real customers who have done business with you about why they are not going to do business with you and handle it literally right here okay after we handle our objections we're going to do a little bit of qualification where we just want to really reiterate like this is who this is for this is who this is not for okay as a great example of that if you're sitting here watching this
(53:53) video and you don't even have a [ __ ] business let alone a business that has any probability at all to ever hit million doll months I don't even know why you're sitting here watching this video go watch a video about how to make like [ __ ] 10K a month or 100K a month or some little [ __ ] like that these videos on my channel on how to hit million doll months are for the big dogs they're for the chosen ones they're for the people with above average intelligence a fuckload of drive a hubris of I deserve million doll months
(54:25) these are for the people who watch [ __ ] like this take action on it have a high probability to go through my inner circle offers Master internet marketing offers make a purchase with us because they see these videos they go out of their way and take action on these videos they get results with the videos and they come back they spend money with me okay this for the big dogs these videos aren't for the [ __ ] small fries there's plenty of small fry content on YouTube go watch that [ __ ] you see that's a great example okay of qualifying in a vssl you want to do is
(54:56) very similar process where you say this is who it's for this is who it's not for that way the person who it's for can further identify that you're clearly talking to them versus again when you're talking to somebody who it's not for but at this point they still haven't disqualified themselves you want to let them know hey this isn't for you this is is for you don't apply don't waste our time don't take the action this is not for you okay you shouldn't even be here right now leave this if you're like this if this is how you are if this is your set of circumstances is this if this
(55:24) where you're at hey this is all for you this is perfect for you go ahead and take action okay qualifying now the final step you want to make a very clear call to action at this point if you haven't done so already whatever it is that you're optimizing for hey go fill out the application below if you're qualified you'll be able to schedule a call with us make sure you book that in and from there we'll get you a lot of information and then we'll have our call looking forward to it okay make your call to action at this particular step
(55:48) nothing to really further explain beyond that okay that's typically how it closes out I do want to be fair in in a u quick shout out if you will to some traditional you know best practices you can pepper in there if you're selling to the general public or technically you could also do this kind of end the video depending on the length you're at right now for the affluent demographic as well you can pepper in some testimonials and then do another final call to action after that again if you do that just make sure the testimonials are highly believable and make sure that you don't
(56:13) go past the length of the video that is considered a best practice for one demographic or the other okay now some key additional insights that I just want to make sure I reiterate okay a fluent demographic shorter vsls more direct more assertive more Punchy general public lot longer lot of skepticism you got to handle straight away needs to be welld designed if you do a presentation you need to be dressing the part in either scenario you need to be the character um also when it comes to analyzing vssl performance okay make
(56:45) sure that if you have a steep drop at the beginning of your video okay something more like this that you redo the beginning of the video because that shows that you have a horrid opener and you need to change it or it might also show that you just tapping into a minority hook one of these is an example and you need to expand to a majority hook to get more people to stick around and think oh this is for me okay other statistics and little best practices I want to make sure I point out uh the engagement rate is a very key statistic but the play rate okay the play rate how many people hit your page and actually
(57:17) press play on the video okay that is a very key metric I have had million dooll months with clients that have a 9% play rate meaning you heard that right 91% of the people hit the page and just leave okay there's a lot of friction generally in those scenarios where there's some kind of like really strong qualifier headline used for who it's not for and who it's for that way the wrong people just leave straight away okay for a higher play rate video meaning again quantity of people that hit the page versus quantity of people that press play a good play rate can be anywhere in the 30% obviously all the way up above
(57:49) that um usually the lower the play rate is there's usually some kind of discrepancy some kind of Disconnect between what got the into the page and what they found on the page when they got there that can also sometimes be really low depending on the demographic so let's use the example that you sell to the blueco collar Niche I am not sure why this is the case for these specific folks but anytime I run an offer to like roofers uh asphalt contractors even some of the solar guys that I imagine are new to the industry or transitioned from Roofing just blue collar as a niche in
(58:20) general the play rates are always like singled digigit percentiles are in the teens at Max typically with blue demographics will take what's covered on the vssl and just turn it into sections on the page instead if we see that low play rate Trend play out okay in other instances we can have a low play rate because we have a [ __ ] thumbnail and headline combination in other instances we can have a very low play rate from having too much information on the page below our vssl okay in almost all instances when we run any kind of vssl
(58:52) funnel we want the attention to be on the vssl itself if you've watched any of my videos or one of my most recent ones is an example on how to generate 40 to 50 qualified calls per day you'll know that one of the best practices that I list is having a very simplified page like this where you have a headline the vssl and the application if you're doing a call funnel as an example this gets you a higher play rate because the only thing on the page to consume the information is the video when you give people remember this lesson I talked about throughout this video okay I've
(59:22) talked again and again about this idea that human beings are trying to qualify whether some things for them or not they're trying to bias towards fast action because they don't want to be there longer than they need to if I have all these additional sections on the page that explain additional information about what it is that I do I have a higher probability that the person hits the page and then Scrolls and then makes that determination of this is for me or not okay if I do not have any of that down there and I solely have my headline
(59:52) vssl and application although inefficient in the mind of the person who just hit the the page the only way for them to get the information that they want is in the video so therefore I have a higher play rate you see so again these different variables can dictate whether you get a high play rate a low play rate sometimes it could be demographic the thumbnail used uh whether you have additional sections on the page for the person to make that conclusive decision on their own faster or not all these things start to become you know variables that you've got to consider for why you might have a low
(1:00:19) play rate the higher the play rate the better uh in terms of platform usage okay I always use wistia I have no affiliate relationship with WIA to be clear I just love wistia's video analytics I love their customization options um I want to really clear I love the the analytics section in Wisa more than anything else the way they visualize the analytics is of the utmost value to my organization as an agency when we're considering marketing decisions on behalf of clients and businesses and our own business I just want to be very clear and saying Wisa
(1:00:48) just triumphs all of the other platforms when it comes to the analytics and just the hosting in addition to that they do a video thumbnail which I really love we find tremendously Higher Play rates when we have a video thumbnail rather than just a static image thumbnail okay there's a few things I want to note that if you for some reason don't follow my advice and use some other version of a of a vsl hosting platform like Vimeo or [ __ ] YouTube or whatever else the [ __ ] out there nowadays I want to be fair in saying that you might think okay
(1:01:18) I only have the ability to use an image thumbnail let me make one of those image thumbnails that like encourages pressing the play button those always perform like [ __ ] not not sure why they always perform like [ __ ] if you are going to use an image or a video thumbnail for that matter it should be something that people see that gives them kind of like a glimpse into what the video is going to cover it should be like a very key moment in the video that says yeah I would like to watch this you know this makes sense this looks like it's for me you know versus if you just do one of those it's like a YouTube ad starting
(1:01:46) off with stop don't press Skip it's like that never [ __ ] works never it always performs like [ __ ] people don't scroll through their news feed and actually say oh this guy told me to stop me stop you think people are an idiot like come on same thing with these image thumbnails okay they should not for any reason be the oh press play you know stupid okay anyway Wisa is my preferred platform after I look at the play rate and after I'm using wistia Wisa gives me an analytic called engagement okay the
(1:02:16) engagement metric is critical it also visualizes on the vssl itself this graph that represents where people are dropping off in the video and how well I am retain in them just to put it in perspective one of the best engagement retention charts I've ever seen looked like this where it had a very steady decline almost every vssl typically looks more like this where there's a pretty significant drop at the beginning and then usually after that point you retain people pretty well with a much lower drop off rate keep in mind that's totally normal as people have that perspective of oh this is for me this is
(1:02:53) not for me they drop off and they go take the action or they leave and that's okay this being the best uh there's a few key lessons here that I learned that I'd like to point out for you now this was 2 minutes it was for an affluent demographic it was the most direct nonf fluff vssl that I've ever seen in my life and I put it inside of this vssl sop but again you're paying me money if you want to watch that vssl you're joining into the Inner Circle twice a month one-on-one calls weekly group calls group chat full of rich people trying to get richer and our quarterly masterminds or you're joining into my
