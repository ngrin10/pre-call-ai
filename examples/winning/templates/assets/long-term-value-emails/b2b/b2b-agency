**Subject: Why great apps die in obscurity (and mediocre ones dominate)**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Brutal truth: Your app could be 10x better than your competitors and still fail.

Here’s why:

**The Hidden Crisis**

Every day, 3,000 new apps launch. 87% fail within 12 months. Most have great products.

It’s not a product problem. It’s a discovery problem.

**What Changed**

5 years ago:

- Build great product → users find you
- App store optimization worked
- Word of mouth spread naturally
- Competition was manageable

Today:

- Great products are everywhere
- App stores are oversaturated
- Organic reach is near zero
- Users have infinite choices

Your biggest competitor isn’t another app. It’s TikTok, Netflix, and every other thing fighting for your users’ eyeballs.

**The Winners Are Different**

Look at recent breakout apps:

- BeReal: 0 → 100M users in 2 years
- Wordle: Viral overnight success
- Cal AI: 175K downloads in 90 days

What do they have in common?

They didn’t rely on app stores. They didn’t buy expensive ads. They got discovered organically through content.

**The Reality Check**

If you’re building an amazing product but nobody knows about it…

You don’t have a product business. You have an expensive hobby.

Next week: The simple test to see if you have a distribution problem.

P.S. Cal AI was an amazing product for 8 months before anyone cared. Then we changed their distribution strategy. 30M views later…

### Email 2

**Subject: The 2-minute test that reveals your distribution problem**

{{contact.first_name}},

Quick question: Where did your last 100 users discover your app?

Take 2 minutes and check your analytics.

**If most came from:**

✅ **Paid ads:** You’re renting growth (expensive but predictable)

✅ **App store search:** You’re fighting algorithm wars (competitive but possible)

❌ **Organic social:** You’re winning distribution (sustainable and scalable)

**The Brutal Math**

If organic social is less than 30% of your acquisition… You have a distribution problem.

**Why This Matters**

**Paid Acquisition:**

- Average CAC: $29 for consumer apps
- Requires constant spending
- Growth stops when budget stops
- Getting 20% more expensive yearly

**Organic Discovery:**

- Essentially free acquisition
- Compounds over time
- Content works forever
- Gets easier with momentum

**Real Numbers**

Uber, TikTok, Notion, BeReal in their growth phases:

- 70%+ organic acquisition
- $0 spent on their first million users
- Content-driven discovery

Your competition is probably burning $29 per user while you could be getting them for free.

**The Trust Factor**

When someone discovers your app through: ❌ **An ad:** They know you’re trying to sell them ✅ **Authentic content:** They discover you naturally

Which feels more trustworthy?

**Next week’s focus**

“Okay Dawson, I have a distribution problem. But I tried working with creators before and it didn’t work.”

I’ll show you exactly why.

Dawson

P.S. Most founders I talk to have never even checked this metric. Don’t be most founders.

### Email 3

**Subject: Why hiring 5 creators is worse than hiring 0**

{{contact.first_name}},

Got tons of replies to yesterday’s email:

“I tried working with creators. Didn’t work.”

Let me guess what happened:

**The Typical Creator Journey**

Week 1: “Let’s work with creators!” Week 2: DM 50 creators, get 5 responses

Week 3: Brief creators, half ghost you Week 4: Get 3 videos, 1 is decent Week 5: “Maybe we should just do ads…”

Sound familiar?

**The Real Problem**

You weren’t doing creator marketing wrong. You were doing random creator marketing.

Here’s the difference:

**Random Creator Marketing:**

- Find 5-10 creators
- Hope they make something good
- Post and pray
- Wonder why nothing works

**Systematic Creator Marketing (VGC):**

- Test 600+ pieces monthly
- Find patterns in what works
- Scale only winners
- Growth becomes predictable

**The Math Problem**

5 creators × 2 posts each = 10 experiments Viral rate: ~1% Expected winners: 0.1 (basically zero)

250 creators × 2.4 posts each = 600 experiments

Viral rate: ~1% Expected winners: 6 (now we’re talking)

**Why Volume Changes Everything**

At 10 posts: You’re gambling At 600 posts: You’re discovering

Real example: Chart AI tried DIY creators for 6 months. Made 78 videos. Got 45K total views.

Switched to systematic VGC. Found viral format in week 3. One video hit 2.7M views. That format became their goldmine.

**The Infrastructure Reality**

To test 600 pieces monthly, you need:

- 250+ reliable creators
- Quality control systems
- Pattern recognition tools
- Campaign management infrastructure

Building this yourself = 6 months + $100K+ investment.

Or… you could partner with someone who already has it built.

Want the complete breakdown of why traditional approaches fail and what works instead?

Next week: The exact VGC framework that generates predictable viral content.

P.S. “But Dawson, won’t 600 videos all look the same?” Only if you brief them like everyone else. I’ll show you the brief that generates 200 unique perspectives.

### Email 4

**Subject: How to get 200 unique videos from one brief**

{{contact.first_name}},

The #1 question about VGC:

“Won’t 600 videos all look the same?”

Only if you write briefs like everyone else.

**Traditional Brief (Kills Creativity):**

"Say exactly this:

Hi everyone! I just discovered [product] and it's amazing!

Here are three reasons why I love it...

[List features]

Use code SAVE20!"

Result: 50 identical robots reading scripts

**VGC Brief (Unleashes Creativity):**

Core message: Show how [product] solved [specific problem]

Your interpretation:

- Share YOUR story
- Use YOUR words
- Show YOUR way
- Keep YOUR style

Inspiration angles:

- Day in the life
- Before/after
- Problem/solution
- Transformation story

Result: 200 unique perspectives on one theme

**Real Example**

Brand: Cal AI (calendar app) Traditional brief: “Talk about our scheduling features” Results: 20 boring feature videos

VGC brief: “Show how Cal AI saved your chaotic day” Results:

- Entrepreneur juggling 12 meetings
- Student managing study schedule
- Parent organizing family calendar
- Freelancer tracking multiple clients
- Team lead coordinating projects

Same core message. 200 different stories.

**Why This Works**

Creators aren’t actors. They’re storytellers.

Give them a script = fake content Give them a theme = authentic content

**The Scaling Secret**

Week 1: One brief → 200 interpretations Week 2: Identify top 5 performing angles

Week 3: Create briefs around those 5 Week 4: 1,000 targeted pieces

From one idea to exponential growth.

**The Pattern Discovery**

When 200 creators interpret one brief:

- Natural A/B testing happens
- Different hooks emerge
- Various formats appear
- Authentic voices shine
- Patterns become visible

You’re not creating 200 copies. You’re running 200 experiments.

Next week: Why timing your content actually drive downloads (hint: follower count doesn’t matter).

Dawson

P.S. Cal AI’s polished agency video: 5K views. Their “ugly” authentic test: 2.7M views. Quality vs. authenticity isn’t even close.

### Email 5

**Subject: The 3K follower creator who destroyed the 500K influencer**

{{contact.first_name}},

True story that changed how I think about creators:

**The Setup:**

- Big influencer: 500K followers, $10K fee
- Micro creator: 3K followers, $200 fee

**The Results:**

- Big influencer: 1.2M views, 23 app downloads
- Micro creator: 890K views, 234 app downloads

10x better conversion at 2% of the cost.

**Why This Happens**

Large creators (500K+):

- 1-2% engagement rate
- Broad, unfocused audience
- Promote everything
- Followers don’t trust as much

Micro creators (3K-50K):

- 5-10% engagement rate
- Niche, passionate audience
- Selective with promotions
- High trust with followers

**The VGC Strategy**

Instead of 10 big creators for $100K… Activate 500 micro creators for $100K.

The math:

- 10 big creators = 10 chances to win
- 500 micro creators = 500 chances to win

At 5% viral rate:

- Big creator approach: Maybe 1 winner
- VGC approach: 25 guaranteed winners

**How to Identify Converting Creators**

Forget follower count. Look for:

**Engagement Rate** (likes + comments ÷ followers)

- Under 3% = Skip
- 3-5% = Test
- 5%+ = Priority

**Comment Quality**

- Generic (“nice!” “cool!”) = Bad
- Questions/discussions = Good
- Personal stories = Excellent

**Niche Alignment**

- Broad lifestyle = Lower conversion
- Specific interest = Higher conversion
- Problem-focused = Highest conversion

**The Infrastructure Challenge**

Finding these creators manually:

- 10 hours to find 50 quality creators
- 50% will ghost you
- 25 viable creators
- Weeks of work per batch

This is why VGC requires infrastructure.

The patterns only emerge at scale. And scale requires systems.

**The Discovery Process**

Week 1: Test 100 micro creators Week 2: Identify top 10 performers Week 3: Find similar creator types Week 4: Scale winning creator profiles

Next week: Why timing your content wrong costs you 70% of your views.

Dawson

P.S. That 3K creator? We’ve worked with her 47 times since. She knows exactly what converts for apps like yours. This is the power of systematic creator relationships.

### Email 6

**Subject: Why posting at 2 PM kills 70% of your views**

{{contact.first_name}},

Most creators post whenever they feel like it.

That’s like running ads with your eyes closed.

**The Brutal Reality**

Wrong timing = 70% fewer views Wrong format = 60% fewer shares Wrong hook = 50% fewer conversions

But here’s what most miss: These windows change weekly.

**The Moving Target**

What worked last month:

- TikTok: 6-10 AM, 7-9 PM
- Instagram: 11 AM-1 PM, 5-7 PM
- Platform prefers: Vertical videos, 15-30 seconds

What works this month:

- TikTok: 9-11 AM, 8-10 PM
- Instagram: 2-4 PM, 6-8 PM
- Platform prefers: Horizontal videos, 30-60 seconds

**The Algorithm Evolution**

Platforms change their preferences constantly:

- To fight competitor features
- To increase engagement time
- To push new creator tools
- To optimize ad revenue

**Why Individual Creators Can’t Keep Up**

Managing optimal timing for:

- 5 platforms
- 12 time zones
- 4 content types
- 3 audience segments
- Weekly algorithm changes

= 720 variables to track

Impossible for one person. Easy for systematic infrastructure.

**The VGC Advantage**

When you have 250 creators posting:

- 600 experiments weekly
- Real-time algorithm feedback
- Instant trend detection
- Optimal timing discovery
- Platform preference mapping

**Real Example**

Cal AI’s performance by timing:

Monday 2 PM posts: 12K average views Monday 9 AM posts: 67K average views

Same creator. Same content. 458% difference.

**The Compound Effect**

Optimal timing + optimal format + optimal hooks = 15x better performance.

This is why systematic VGC destroys random creator posts.

**Your Competition Is Moving**

Right now, apps in your category are discovering VGC.

In 90 days, they’ll have:

- Optimized timing data
- Viral format libraries
- Trained creator networks
- Predictable growth systems

The window to dominate is closing.

But today? It’s wide open.

Next week: The exact 90-day transformation plan that takes apps from invisible to inevitable.

**Subject: From invisible to inevitable in 90 days**

{{contact.first_name}},

Let me show you exactly what happens when an app commits to systematic VGC.

**Week 1-2: “Holy sh*t, that’s a lot of content”**

- 50+ creators onboarded
- 150 videos in production
- First posts go live Day 3
- Your phone starts buzzing with notifications

Reality: Your app is now on 50+ creator phones being genuinely tested.

**Week 3-4: “Wait… something’s happening”**

- 300+ videos live
- 500K+ total views
- Best single video: 50K+ views
- First pattern signals emerging

Reality: Learning more about your users in 4 weeks than 4 months of paid ads.

**Week 5-6: “We found what works!”**

- 450+ videos live
- 3-5 viral formats identified
- Daily downloads: 200+
- Clear winning patterns

Key insight: Your audience responds to “problem/solution” format 3x better than “day in the life.”

**Week 7-8: “Double down on winners”**

- 600+ videos live
- 2M+ monthly views
- 3.2% conversion rate
- Paid ad team using organic winners as creative

Reality: Your CAC drops 40% because you’re scaling proven content.

**Week 9-12: “This is actually working”**

- 1,800+ total videos
- 5M+ total views
- +127% MRR growth
- Predictable growth machine built

**Real Example: Quittr’s Transformation**

Started: $31K MRR Ended: $94K MRR (+203%)

Results:

- 8.3M total views
- 47K new users
- 203% MRR growth
- Sustainable growth system

**The Compound Effect**

Month 1: Foundation (discovering what works) Month 2: Acceleration (scaling winners)

Month 3: Domination (owning your category) Month 6+: Your competitors can’t catch up

**Why 90 Days Matters**

Apps that commit for 90 days see:

- 127% average growth
- 41% CAC reduction
- 3.2x ROAS improvement
- Permanent growth infrastructure

Apps that quit early get nothing.

**Your Next Decision**

Tomorrow, you’ll make one of three choices:

1. **Do nothing:** Keep burning money on ads while competitors build VGC systems
2. **Try DIY:** Spend 6 months building what we already have
3. **Partner with us:** Start your 90-day transformation immediately

Only one leads to market domination.
