Subject: **Why apps with worse features get 10x more downloads**

Body: 

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Dawson here - founder of EVO Marketing. Saw you're exploring how to get more eyes on your app.

Based on what you shared, you're not doing much content yet and wondering where to begin.

You probably think you need to find viral creators or hire an agency. And you've likely tried reaching out to creators, watching competitor content, maybe posting a few times yourself.

Here's something that makes no sense: The best apps often lose to worse ones.

Your app probably has better features. Cleaner design. Smarter functionality. Yet competitors with junky apps are crushing it.

Why? The game changed. It's not about product anymore. It's about distribution.

Think about how YOU discover new apps. Not through app stores anymore. Through your feed. Through people you follow. Through content that catches your eye.

The brutal reality:

- 5 million apps exist
- People try maybe 3 new apps monthly
- Your odds are basically zero

Great features won't fix this. Neither will a prettier design.

I learned this helping Cal AI. Superior product for 18 months. Nobody cared.

Then they changed their distribution approach. 30 million views in 90 days. As a result, they also got 175K new users download their app in this time. Now everyone knows them.

Same app. Different approach. Night and day results.

It was understanding that discovery happens differently now. Apps winning today don't have better features - they have better distribution systems.

The old playbook is dead:

- Build great features → Users find you
- Word spreads → Growth happens

Today's reality:

- Great products everywhere
- Users overwhelmed with options
- Attention is the new currency
- Distribution determines winners

Chart AI learned this the hard way. Spent months perfecting features. Crickets.

Then they shifted focus to distribution. 4.1 million views in 45 days. Same app, different approach.

That competitor who just passed you? Their product isn't better.

Their distribution strategy is.

This isn't about paid ads. That's a different problem. This is about owned distribution that compounds over time.

More on this soon.

### Email #2 - Pre-Call Value (Just Getting Started)

Subject: 3,000 new apps launch daily. Here's how to stand out

Body: 

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Dawson here from Evo Marketing. Quick insight before our call.

Every day, 3,000 new apps launch. Here's why yours can still win. When someone sees an app mentioned 5+ times by different creators, psychology kicks in.

This "social proof at scale" is how unknown apps leapfrog established ones.

But here's the real opportunity most miss:

Every piece of content is an asset.

Post once, it works for months. While competitors rent attention through ads, you're building owned audiences.

**Traditional approach:**

- Post 20 times, pray one works
- Learn nothing from failures
- Growth stays random
- Burn out trying harder

**Systematic approach:**

- Test 600 variations
- AI spots patterns in days
- Scale winners immediately
- Growth becomes predictable

When you test at scale, patterns emerge.

You discover your app's "viral DNA" - the exact messages, formats, and hooks your audience can't ignore.

Chart AI discovered this after wasting 6 months on "quality over quantity." Made 78 perfect videos. Got 45K views. Zero revenue.

Switched to volume testing. Week 3, found their viral formula. One video hit 1.2M plays. That format became their goldmine.

Now they can create viral content on demand. Because they know their patterns.

The compound effect is real:

- Month 1: 600 pieces = foundation
- Month 3: 1,800 pieces = momentum
- Month 6: 3,600 pieces = unstoppable

The compound effect means starting now vs 6 months later isn't a 6-month difference.

It's exponential. Early movers build insurmountable advantages.

From hoping something works to knowing what works. That's the transformation.

The compound effect means starting now vs 6 months later isn't a 6-month difference. It's exponential. Early movers build insurmountable advantages.

On our call, we'll chat about how this applies to your app specifically.

### Email #3 - Pre-Call Value (Just Getting Started)

Subject: **The fastest path from invisible to known**

Body: 

Hey there,

Dawson here. Important distinction before our call.

A question I get from every app founder: "Should I focus on paid ads or organic content?"

Here's what most people miss - it's not either/or. It's about the right order.

When nobody knows your app exists, you need discovery first.

And the fastest-growing apps figured out something others haven't: they treat content like product development.

This approach is called VGC (Viral Growth Content), and it's revolutionizing app growth. Here's the difference:

**Traditional Content:**

- Make some videos
- Post and hope
- Random results
- Slow growth

**VGC Approach:**

- Test everything systematically
- Find what resonates
- Scale winners immediately
- Explosive growth

Think of it like A/B testing for growth. Instead of guessing what content works, you test until you know.

Cal AI's transformation shows the power:

- Started: 5 random TikToks weekly
- Switched to: Systematic VGC testing
- Result: 200M+ total views

Key: Found 3 "golden formats" that consistently go viral

The breakthrough isn't making better content. It's making more tests to find what works.

When you test 600 pieces instead of 20, magic happens:

- Patterns become obvious
- Winners stand out clearly
- Growth becomes predictable
- Success becomes repeatable

This isn't about creativity or luck. It's about data and systems.

The most exciting part? Once you find your patterns, you can replicate success indefinitely. That's how apps go from unknown to unstoppable.

It's not about replacing what works. It's about multiplying it.

Let's dig into the details on the call.

### Email #4 - Pre-Call Value (Just Getting Started)

Subject: How Cal AI got 30M views and 1.6M+ downloads in 90 days

Body: 

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Every time I tell people about my work with Cal AI, they assume I'm exaggerating.

From 5 random TikToks per week to 30M views and 1.6M+ downloads

In 90 days.

Jake and Alfie weren't marketing geniuses. They were developers who built an AI calorie tracking app that nobody knew existed.

For 18 months, they had the better product. Their competitor had the users.

"We've tried everything - ads are burning cash, our 5 TikToks a week aren't moving the needle." they told me.

I told them something that changed their trajectory forever:

"Stop trying to create the perfect video. Start testing 600 imperfect ones. You'll find 3 that work, and those 3 will change everything."

They thought I was insane. And here's what happened:

Month 1: 150 videos went live. Most flopped.

Month 2: Found their first viral format - "AI scheduling fails"

Month 2: That format hit 2.7M views

Month 3: 30M views for the quarter

Craziest part? They did this with zero marketing experience. Just developers who trusted the process.

Started testing content systematically instead of posting randomly. Found formats that clicked with their audience.

That's what happens when you stop perfecting and start testing.

The results speak for themselves:

- Cal AI: 150M+ impressions, #1 in Health & Fitness
- Chart AI: 11M+ impressions in 45 days, #3 in Top Apps
- Pageant: 9M+ impressions in 45 days

Different apps. Same systematic approach. Predictable results.

Cal AI's biggest regret? "We should have started this 18 months earlier."

That experience is exactly why I built this system - to bring these results to more apps.

Next - Chart AI, a trade analyzing tool, tried the traditional route first. Made beautiful content. Got nowhere.

Then switched approaches. Tested everything. Scaled to 2.7M views in just 5 days. Hit #3 in Top Apps.

Pagent was stuck with an amazing product without users for months. Nothing moved the needle.

New approach: Test different angles until something resonates.

Result: 9M+ impressions in 45 days and 3,100+ comments driving awareness and downloads.

I'm not sharing these to impress you. I'm sharing them because every one started exactly where you are - great app, no visibility.

The difference? They stopped guessing and started testing.

Notice I'm not promising overnight success.

This takes work.

But it's work that compounds.

- Dawson

### Email #5 - Pre-Call Value (Just Getting Started)

Subject: How to test 600 videos with just 2 hours/week

Body: 

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Hey, Dawson here. Wanted to address the big question before our call.

I know what you're thinking. "600 videos sounds amazing but impossible"

Here's the game-changer: You don't do it yourself. You plug into systems that already exist.

After helping Cal AI reach 30M views, I kept getting the same call:

"Dawson, I know content works but I have no idea where to start."

That's when I realized - you don't need another course or consultant. You need infrastructure that already exists.

I spent years building this because I watched too many great apps die while inferior ones dominated. The difference wasn't the product. It was distribution.

What makes this different? You're not hiring an agency.

You're plugging into a system that's already generated 200M+ views. No learning curve.

No trial and error. Just proven patterns applied to your app.

Your app deserves to be discovered. This infrastructure makes it inevitable.

The infrastructure our clients get access to:

1. Creator Network (250+ already creating)
2. Creative Direction (viral experts managing quality)
3. AI Pattern Recognition (spots winners automatically)
4. Distribution Automation (scales winners instantly)
5. Campaign Systems (running 24/7 without management)

Your actual time investment:

Week 1-2: Setup (2 hours total)

- Share your app vision
- Confirm target audience
- Approve initial directions

Week 3+: Optimization (30 min/week)

- Review performance data
- Make strategic decisions
- Watch growth accelerate

**What This Means:**

You focus on your app. Systems handle the distribution. Growth happens systematically.

Chart AI's founder said it best: "I was drowning trying to do content myself. Now I spend 2 hours a week on it and get 100x better results."

This isn't about working harder. It's about working systematically.

The beauty of starting fresh:

- No bad habits to break
- No sunk costs to justify
- Just pure opportunity ahead

You get to skip all the mistakes others made and jump straight to what works.

We'll talk about your specific path on the strategy call.

### Email #6 - Pre-Call Value (Just Getting Started)

**Subject: The next 90 days define your app’s position**

Body: 

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Right now, you have an advantage most apps would kill for.

You're early enough to build distribution dominance before the market gets crowded.

Here's the opportunity timeline:

**Starting Today:**

- Month 1: Foundation built, testing begins
- Month 2: Patterns discovered, growth accelerates
- Month 3: Compound effect kicks in
- Month 6: Category leadership possible

**Starting in 6 Months:**

- More competitors using content
- Higher bar for viral
- Harder to stand out
- Playing catch-up forever

The math of waiting:

While you plan, competitors post.

While you research, they learn.

While you decide, they grow.

But here's the exciting part - most apps still don't know about systematic content scaling. The window is wide open for apps ready to move.

Quittr almost missed their window.

Competition was heating up.

Investors getting nervous.

They made the leap just in time. Now they own their category.

The question isn't whether content will determine winners - it already does. The question is whether you'll be one of them.

This is your chance to build something extraordinary:

- Turn unknown app into household name
- Build distribution moat competitors can't cross
- Create predictable, scalable growth
- Own your category

Everything you need exists. The systems. The playbook. The proof it works.

The only thing missing is your decision to begin.

# Universal Emails (for all 3 segments)

### Email #7 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: The difference between traditional UGC and what we do**

Hey,

Dawson from EVO. Important distinction before our call.

Traditional UGC agencies make 20-30 "high-quality" videos and hope something works.

We test 600+ variations to KNOW what works.

It's the difference between guessing and data. Between hoping and engineering.

Pageant tried two UGC agencies. Pretty videos, zero growth.

We found their viral patterns in week 3. 9M+ impressions in 45 days.

The difference? Volume creates data. Data reveals patterns. Patterns drive predictable growth.

Traditional UGC is gambling. VGC is science.

- Dawson

### Email #8 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: Why more creators won’t work**

Hey,

Dawson here. Common misconception to address.

"Can't I just hire more creators to scale?"

By creator #30, you're running an agency for yourself. But the real problem?

Volume without intelligence is just noise.

When you're drowning in creator management, you can't see patterns. You're too busy in your messages app to analyze what works.

Cal AI tried this. Chaos. Then switched to infrastructure. 30M views.

The difference? They could finally SEE what worked and replicate it.

### Email #9- Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

Subject: **The $50K mistake apps make before product-market fit**

Hey,

Dawson here. Need to address the expensive mistake I see every week.

App founders come to me after burning through their marketing budget. Same story:

"We spent $30K on TikTok ads. Nothing."

"Hired influencers for $20K. Crickets."

"Dropped $50K testing everything. Still stuck."

Here's what's happening - they're doing the right things in the wrong order.

Think about it: Would you amplify a message before knowing if it resonates?

Would you pay for billboards before testing your tagline?

Yet that's exactly what apps do when they jump straight to paid ads.

Right now, hundreds of apps are burning $50K on Facebook ads with "professional" creative.

Beautiful videos.

Zero traction.

They're amplifying messages nobody cares about.

**Here's the sequence that actually works:**

*Months 1-3: Find what resonates*

Test 600+ organic variations for a fraction of ad costs. Discover the 3-5 formats that click. This is when you find that one angle that gets 1M+ views organically.

*Months 2-4: Build authentic trust*

Add micro-influencers showing real use cases. Not for reach - for credibility. People need to see others like them using your app.

*Months 3+: Amplify proven winners*

NOW run ads. Use content you KNOW works. Same budget, 10x results. Watch CAC (the cost to acquire a customer) drop 91%.

The expensive mistake isn't running ads. It's running ads before knowing what works.

**Here's the math right now:**

*Random ads with untested creative:*

$50K spend → 500 installs → $100 CAC → Runway burns fast

*Ads with proven viral content:*

$50K spend → 5,000 installs → $10 CAC → Sustainable growth

Same money. 10x difference. Just sequence.

But here's what kills me - agencies profit from this mistake. They'll happily take $20K/month to run ads with creative that "looks nice" but hasn't been tested.

Meanwhile, your competitor who starts with organic is finding their viral DNA for 1/10th the cost.

By the time you figure out your message, they've dominated organic, built trust through influencers, AND scaled with proven content.

The sequence isn't optional. It's how modern app growth works:

- First: Discover what resonates (organic testing)
- Second: Build authentic trust (micro-influencers)
- Third: Amplify what works (paid ads)

Skip steps = gambling. Follow sequence = predictable growth.

Your competitors know this. How much more will you spend learning the hard way?

### Email #10 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: Volume testing doesn’t mean cheap content**

Hey,

Dawson here.

I hear this one often - "We're premium. We can't post everywhere."

The reality is, testing 600 pieces ≠ posting 600 pieces.

It means finding the 3-5 formats that represent your brand perfectly AND drive growth.

Luxury meditation app tested 600 variations. Found 3 premium formats. Now they ONLY use those 3.

Brand integrity intact. 4x growth achieved.

The brands that stay "exclusive" by avoiding content? They stay exclusively unknown.

Looking forward to our call.

### Email #11 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

Subject: **What if I’m already getting results?**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

If you're already seeing results from content, you're ahead of most. Seriously.

But here's what I've learned: There's "good" growth and there's explosive growth.

**Good growth looks like:**

- Steady monthly increases
- Some viral moments
- Decent ROI
- Linear trajectory

**Explosive growth looks like:**

- Finding your viral DNA
- Predictable viral creation
- Compound momentum
- Exponential trajectory

Chart AI had good growth. 2-3 solid videos monthly. Decent downloads.

Then they added systematic testing. Hit #3 in Top Apps.

Same app. Same market. Different approach.

The question isn't "Is my current approach working?" It's "What am I leaving on the table?"

If you're getting 10K downloads monthly, could it be 100K?

If growth is 20% monthly, could it be 200%?

If you're #50 in your category, could you be #5?

Good is the enemy of great. And great is what changes everything.
