# Pre-Call Segment #2: DIY With Creators

### **EMAIL 1: Welcome & Gap Creation**

**Subject**: **You're right about content (here's the problem)**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Dawson here - founder of EVO Marketing. Thanks for booking time with our team.

Saw you’re managing creators yourself - that tells me you already understand the biggest shift in app growth: content is how people discover apps now.

You get it. You're ahead of 90% of founders still burning cash on ads.

And if you're like most smart founders we work with, you've probably discovered:

- A few creators who really deliver
- That one video that actually drove downloads
- Glimpses of what's possible with content

But you've also got:

- Message notifications at midnight
- Creators who ghost you mid-campaign
- 20+ hours weekly just coordinating
- Growth that's still stuck

The real cost isn't your time - it's what happens while you're stuck managing chaos.

Every Sunday you spend chasing creators is a Sunday your competitor spends growing.

Every hour editing videos is an hour not talking to users.

Every DM to a flaky creator is energy drained from your vision.

Meanwhile, CPMs keep rising 20% yearly. The math is getting worse, not better.

Pagent, The Voting App, went from 78 videos over 6 months to 600 videos monthly.

Found their viral format in week 3. Got 9M+ impressions in 45 days.

Chart AI, The Trading App, got 11M+ impressions in 45 days as well.

They didn't work harder. They worked differently.

They plugged into infrastructure that's generated 300M+ views and 2M+ downloads across all clients.

We'll dig into what this could look like for you on our call.

- Dawson

P.S. The fact that you're already doing content puts you way ahead. Now imagine [multiplying your results by 10x without working more.](https://www.notion.so/%7B%7B%20custom_values.sales_asset__offer_overview__pricing%20%7D%7D)

### Email #2 - Pre-Call Value (DIY With Creators)

**Subject: Why smart founders still get stuck with creators**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Hey, Dawson here from EVO. Something important to share before we talk.

Earlier I mentioned testing velocity. Let me explain why this changes everything.

Here's what most businesses don't realize:

**Finding one breakthrough content format requires ~200 tests.**

Not my opinion. Data from 40+ brands we've worked with.

Here's the catch - to execute successfully, you have to get through the the 9-part creator management trap:

**Step 1: Finding Creators**

- 20 hours scrolling TikTok
- DM 100 people
- 10 respond

**Step 2: Vetting Creators**

- Which 3 of those 10 are actually good?
- How do you even know?
- Usually find out after paying

**Step 3: Closing Creators**

- Negotiate rates ($50? $500?)
- Get them to commit
- Half ghost you here

**Step 4: Managing Creators**

- Message explosion
- "Where's my content?"
- Chasing deliverables

**Step 5: Content Ideation**

- What should they make?
- Brief each one differently
- Hope they understand

**Step 6: Quality Control**

- 90% is unusable
- Wrong brand voice
- Terrible hooks

**Step 7: Testing Strategy**

- No framework
- Random posts
- Hope something works

**Step 8: Pattern Recognition**

- Too busy managing to analyze
- Missing what actually works
- Can't see the forest for the trees

**Step 9: Scaling Winners**

- Found something that worked?
- How do you replicate it?
- Start the loop over

And not to mention, the markets shift every 90 days. New trends. New competitors. New algorithms.

So while you're slowly testing, the game changes.

This is why most businesses plateau. They can't test fast enough to find winners before the landscape shifts.

Chart AI spent 6 months in this loop. 40 hours/week. 78 total videos. Nothing worked.

Then they discovered a completely different approach. Tripled revenue in 90 days.

The businesses breaking through test 600+ monthly. They're not guessing - they're discovering through volume.

So how do you escape this 9-step trap AND get to 600 tests monthly?

Stay posted, I'll show you exactly how.

### Email #3 - Pre-Call Value (DIY With Creators)

**Subject: How to test 600 videos with just 2 hours/week**
Body:

Hey,

Dawson here. Key concept before our call.

Earlier, I broke down why you need 600+ tests monthly to find what works and scale.

Your might be thinking "I'll just hire more creators."

Here's why that breaks: Every creator multiplies chaos.

**For every creator you add, you have:**

- One more brief to write
- One more WhatsApp thread
- One more person to chase
- One more quality guess

By creator #30, you're running an agency for yourself.

But here's the real problem - even if you could manage 100 creators, you'd still be flying blind.

Why? Because volume without intelligence is just noise.

When you're drowning in creator management, you can't step back and see patterns. You're too busy in WhatsApp to analyze what's actually working.

The breakthrough happens when you combine massive volume WITH intelligence:

**Here's how we solve all 9 creator problems at once:**

**Finding Creators**

- Your way: 20 hrs/week scrolling TikTok
- Our way: 250+ creators pre-trained ready to go

**Vetting Quality**

- Your way: Guess based on profile
- Our way: Pre-trained on what works

**Closing Creators**

- Your way: Negotiate, get ghosted
- Our way: Already in the network

**Managing Them**

- Your way: WhatsApp chaos
- Our way: Creative directors managing everything

**Content Ideas**

- Your way: Brief each one differently
- Our way: One brief → 250 perspectives

**Quality Control**

- Your way: 90% garbage
- Our way: 90% usable

**Testing Strategy**

- Your way: Post and pray
- Our way: Pattern recognition across hundreds of tests

**Finding Patterns**

- Your way: Too busy to analyze
- Our way: AI tracking every piece of content

**Scaling Winners**

- Your way: "How do I replicate this?"
- Our way: Systems that amplify winners automatically

**This is VGC (Viral Growth Content) -** systematic testing with creators who actually know what they're doing.

**Real example**: Cal AI went from 5 random TikToks weekly to 600 strategic tests monthly. Never managed another creator. Found 3 viral formats. 30M views in 90 days.

The key difference: They could finally SEE what worked and WHY. Then replicate it at scale.

**How it works:**

1. You brief us once
2. Directors activate network
3. 600+ tests monthly
4. AI finds what works
5. Scale winners
6. Growth becomes predictable

Chart AI went from managing 23 creators (nightmare) to this system. Found their viral format week 3. Revenue tripled.

While you're slowly testing 20 videos hoping for magic, apps with VGC are testing 600 and KNOWING what works.

Building this infrastructure yourself? Like building your own AWS. We already spent years to build it for you. Just plug in.

### Email #4 - Pre-Call Value (DIY With Creators)

**Subject: How Cal AI got 30M views and 175K downloads in 90 days**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Dawson from EVO. Had to share these transformations before we talk.

You're already creating content. You get the grind.

But what if I told you the difference between your 50-100 videos and these results was just... systems?

Every time I tell people about my work with Cal AI, they assume I'm exaggerating.

From 5 random TikToks per week to 30M views and 1.6M+ downloads

In 90 days.

Jake and Alfie weren't marketing geniuses. They were developers who built an AI calorie tracking app that nobody knew existed.

For 18 months, they had the better product. Their competitor had the users.

"We've tried everything - ads are burning cash, our 5 TikToks a week aren't moving the needle." they told me.

I told them something that changed their trajectory forever:

"Stop trying to create the perfect video. Start testing 600 imperfect ones. You'll find 3 that work, and those 3 will change everything."

They thought I was insane. And here's what happened:

Month 1: 150 videos went live. Most flopped.

Month 2: Found their first viral format - "AI scheduling fails"

Month 2: That format hit 2.7M views

Month 3: 30M views for the quarter

Craziest part? They did this with zero marketing experience. Just developers who trusted the process.

Started testing content systematically instead of posting randomly. Found formats that clicked with their audience.

That's what happens when you stop perfecting and start testing.

The results speak for themselves:

- Cal AI: 150M+ impressions, #1 in Health & Fitness
- Chart AI: 11M+ impressions in 45 days, #3 in Top Apps
- Pageant: 9M+ impressions in 45 days

Different apps. Same systematic approach. Predictable results.

Cal AI's biggest regret? "We should have started this 18 months earlier."

That experience is exactly why I built this system - to bring these results to more apps.

Next - Chart AI, a trade analyzing tool, tried the traditional route first. Made beautiful content. Got nowhere.

Then switched approaches. Tested everything. Scaled to 2.7M views in just 5 days. Hit #3 in Top Apps.

Pagent was stuck with an amazing product without users for months. Nothing moved the needle.

New approach: Test different angles until something resonates.

Result: 9M+ impressions in 45 days and 3,100+ comments driving awareness and downloads.

I'm not sharing these to impress you. I'm sharing them because every one started exactly where you are - great app, no visibility.

The difference? They stopped guessing and started testing.

Notice I'm not promising overnight success.

This takes work.

But it's work that compounds.

- Dawson

P.S. [How Cal AI went from 0 to 30M views in 90 days](https://www.notion.so/%7B%7B%20custom_values.sales_asset__offer_overview__pricing%20%7D%7D)

### **Email #5 - Pre-Call Value (DIY With Creators)**

**Subject: Why I started Evo**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

After helping Cal AI reach 30M views, I kept hearing the same thing from founders like you:

"I know content works but I'm drowning in creator management."

"I've seen what's possible but can't scale it myself."

"I'm spending 40 hours a week for linear results."

That's when I realized - you don't need another agency. You need infrastructure.

So I built it. Years later, 250+ creators trained. Systems that run themselves.

**But here's what matters to YOU:**

Right now you're probably:

- Managing 10-30 creators in spreadsheets
- Spending weekends chasing content
- Getting 100-200 pieces monthly at best
- Knowing you're leaving growth on the table

In 30 days, you could be:

- Reviewing data, not chasing creators
- Testing 600+ pieces without the chaos
- Finding your viral DNA systematically
- Actually enjoying weekends again

**The difference:**

Today: You manage creators

Tomorrow: You manage growth

This infrastructure exists because founders like you deserve better than choosing between burnout and slow growth.

Your knowledge + these systems = the breakthrough you've been looking for.

Let's talk about your specific on our call.

# Universal Emails (for all 3 segments)

### Email #7 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: The difference between traditional UGC and what we do**

Hey,

Dawson from EVO. Important distinction before our call.

Traditional UGC agencies make 20-30 "high-quality" videos and hope something works.

We test 600+ variations to KNOW what works.

It's the difference between guessing and data. Between hoping and engineering.

Pageant tried two UGC agencies. Pretty videos, zero growth.

We found their viral patterns in week 3. 9M+ impressions in 45 days.

The difference? Volume creates data. Data reveals patterns. Patterns drive predictable growth.

Traditional UGC is gambling. VGC is science.

- Dawson

### Email #8 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: Why more creators won’t work**

Hey,

Dawson here. Common misconception to address.

"Can't I just hire more creators to scale?"

By creator #30, you're running an agency for yourself. But the real problem?

Volume without intelligence is just noise.

When you're drowning in creator management, you can't see patterns. You're too busy in your messages app to analyze what works.

Cal AI tried this. Chaos. Then switched to infrastructure. 30M views.

The difference? They could finally SEE what worked and replicate it.

- Dawson

### Email #9- Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

Subject: **The $50K mistake apps make before product-market fit**

Hey,

Dawson here. Need to address the expensive mistake I see every week.

App founders come to me after burning through their marketing budget. Same story:

"We spent $30K on TikTok ads. Nothing."

"Hired influencers for $20K. Crickets."

"Dropped $50K testing everything. Still stuck."

Here's what's happening - they're doing the right things in the wrong order.

Think about it: Would you amplify a message before knowing if it resonates?

Would you pay for billboards before testing your tagline?

Yet that's exactly what apps do when they jump straight to paid ads.

Right now, hundreds of apps are burning $50K on Facebook ads with "professional" creative.

Beautiful videos.

Zero traction.

They're amplifying messages nobody cares about.

**Here's the sequence that actually works:**

*Months 1-3: Find what resonates*

Test 600+ organic variations for a fraction of ad costs. Discover the 3-5 formats that click. This is when you find that one angle that gets 1M+ views organically.

*Months 2-4: Build authentic trust*

Add micro-influencers showing real use cases. Not for reach - for credibility. People need to see others like them using your app.

*Months 3+: Amplify proven winners*

NOW run ads. Use content you KNOW works. Same budget, 10x results. Watch CAC (the cost to acquire a customer) drop 91%.

The expensive mistake isn't running ads. It's running ads before knowing what works.

**Here's the math right now:**

*Random ads with untested creative:*

$50K spend → 500 installs → $100 CAC → Runway burns fast

*Ads with proven viral content:*

$50K spend → 5,000 installs → $10 CAC → Sustainable growth

Same money. 10x difference. Just sequence.

But here's what kills me - agencies profit from this mistake. They'll happily take $20K/month to run ads with creative that "looks nice" but hasn't been tested.

Meanwhile, your competitor who starts with organic is finding their viral DNA for 1/10th the cost.

By the time you figure out your message, they've dominated organic, built trust through influencers, AND scaled with proven content.

The sequence isn't optional. It's how modern app growth works:

- First: Discover what resonates (organic testing)
- Second: Build authentic trust (micro-influencers)
- Third: Amplify what works (paid ads)

Skip steps = gambling. Follow sequence = predictable growth.

Your competitors know this. How much more will you spend learning the hard way?

- Dawson

### Email #10 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: Volume testing doesn’t mean cheap content**

Hey,

Dawson here.

I hear this one often - "We're premium. We can't post everywhere."

The reality is, testing 600 pieces ≠ posting 600 pieces.

It means finding the 3-5 formats that represent your brand perfectly AND drive growth.

Luxury meditation app tested 600 variations. Found 3 premium formats. Now they ONLY use those 3.

Brand integrity intact. 4x growth achieved.

The brands that stay "exclusive" by avoiding content? They stay exclusively unknown.

Looking forward to our call.

- Dawson

### Email #11 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

Subject: **What if I’m already getting results?**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

If you're already seeing results from content, you're ahead of most. Seriously.

But here's what I've learned: There's "good" growth and there's explosive growth.

**Good growth looks like:**

- Steady monthly increases
- Some viral moments
- Decent ROI
- Linear trajectory

**Explosive growth looks like:**

- Finding your viral DNA
- Predictable viral creation
- Compound momentum
- Exponential trajectory

Chart AI had good growth. 2-3 solid videos monthly. Decent downloads.

Then they added systematic testing. Hit #3 in Top Apps.

Same app. Same market. Different approach.

The question isn't "Is my current approach working?" It's "What am I leaving on the table?"

If you're getting 10K downloads monthly, could it be 100K?

If growth is 20% monthly, could it be 200%?

If you're #50 in your category, could you be #5?

Good is the enemy of great. And great is what changes everything.

- Dawson
