# Pre-Call Segment #3: Leveraging an Agency

## **AGENCY SEGMENT - OPPORTUNITY FOCUSED**

### Email #1 - Pre-Call Value (Using an Agency)

**Subject:** How to 10x your current results

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Dawson here. Looking forward to our conversation about multiplying your content results.

You're already investing in content, which puts you ahead of 90% of apps. You get it. Content drives growth.

But here's what's exciting - there's a whole new level most apps never discover.

Right now you're probably seeing:

- Professional content output
- Consistent posting schedule
- Some viral moments
- Decent ROI on spend

That's great. Seriously. Most apps never get there.

But the apps dominating their categories? They discovered something that multiplies those results by 10x.

Same effort. Same budget. Completely different outcomes.

I worked with Pageant when they were exactly where you are. Good agency, professional content, 40 videos monthly.

Then they added systematic scaling. Same budget - 9M+ impressions in 45 days. 3,100+ comments driving real engagement.

They didn't work harder. They didn't spend more. They evolved their approach.

The opportunity in front of you: Your current foundation + testing infrastructure = category domination

You've already proven content works. Now let's multiply those results.

- Dawson

### **EMAIL 2: The Ceiling Breakthrough**

**Subject:** What happens when content meets intelligence

Hey,

Dawson here. Wanted to share something before our call you might relate to.

You know that feeling when one piece of content takes off? The views, the downloads, the excitement?

And then the frustration when you can't figure out how to do it again? When you're trying to replicate success but it feels like catching lightning in a bottle?

Imagine knowing exactly WHY it worked and being able to replicate it on demand.

That's the shift happening right now. Apps are moving from "hope it works" to "know it works."

Here's what nobody tells you about traditional content:

- Create quality content → Hope the algorithm likes it
- Post consistently → Watch metrics plateau
- Track performance → But can't replicate success
- Try to do more of what works → Get more of the same results

Now here's what becomes possible with intelligent systems:

- Test at massive scale → Find patterns invisible at small scale
- AI identifies what works → Not guessing, knowing
- Replicate winners immediately → Turn luck into system
- Compound growth systematically → Each win builds on the last

When you test 600 variations instead of 60, patterns become crystal clear.

You discover your app's "viral DNA" - the exact hooks, formats, and angles that make YOUR audience stop scrolling, watch, and download.

Chart AI was creating great content. Getting decent results. Added intelligence systems.

Scaled to 2.7M views in just 5 days. Hit #3 in Top Apps. That approach became their growth engine.

Same team. Same app. They just added intelligence to their content.

The math is compelling:

- 10x more tests = 10x more data
- 10x more data = Clear patterns
- Clear patterns = Predictable growth
- Predictable growth = Market domination

You've already built the foundation. Now multiply it by 10x without working harder.

Talk soon about making this happen.

### **Email #3 - Pre-Call Value (Using an Agency)**

**Subject:** Keep what works, multiply the results

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Dawson from Evo. Quick framework I think you'll find useful before our call.

You don't need to change everything. You need evolution.

Here's what that looks like:

**Keep What's Working:**

- Your brand standards
- Best performing content
- Quality benchmarks
- Current processes

**Add What's Missing:**

- 600+ monthly tests
- AI pattern recognition
- Viral format discovery
- Scale infrastructure

Think of it like a restaurant with amazing recipes. You don't change the recipes - you build systems to serve 10x more customers.

When I worked with Cal AI, they had good content but growth felt capped.

We kept what was working and added systematic testing. 30M views and 1.6M+ downloads later, they only wished they'd evolved sooner.

**The Evolution Path:**

Month 1: Analyze + Amplify

- Study your best content
- Test 600 variations
- Find hidden patterns
- Build on what works

Month 2: Optimize + Scale

- Double down on winners
- Cut what doesn't work
- Add pattern replication
- Growth accelerates

Month 3: Systematize + Dominate

- Predictable viral creation
- Multiple growth channels
- Compound advantages
- Leave competition behind

Chart AI took this path. Added systematic testing to their existing efforts. 11M+ impressions in 45 days.

Evolution beats revolution every time.

Looking forward to exploring this with you

- Dawson

P.S. The best transformations build on existing success. That's what makes them sustainable.

### Email #4 - Pre-Call Value (Using an Agency)

**Subject:** What 600 tests reveal that 60 can't

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Let me show you what becomes possible at scale:

When you test 20-60 pieces monthly, you're playing a guessing game. When you test 600+, patterns become undeniable.

It's not just about volume. It's about what volume reveals.

**At traditional scale (20-60 tests):**

- Some content works, most doesn't
- Success feels random
- Can't identify patterns
- Growth stays linear

**At systematic scale (600+ tests):**

- Clear winners emerge
- Success becomes predictable
- Viral DNA revealed
- Growth goes exponential

Pageant discovered this. Added systematic testing and found viral hooks that drove 9M+ impressions in 45 days.

The compound effect in action:

- Month 1: 600 tests = find your patterns
- Month 3: 1,800 pieces = momentum builds
- Month 6: 3,600 pieces = competition can't catch up

**The Three Growth Layers:**

**Discovery (VGC):**

- Test everything that might work
- Find your viral DNA fast
- Perfect when you need awareness

**Trust (Micro-influencers):**

- 80+ authentic voices
- Build credibility at scale
- Ideal when you need social proof

**Scale (Paid Amplification):**

- Take organic winners
- Amplify with ads
- Maximize every success

The infrastructure to do this already exists. You just need to plug in.

- Dawson

### Email #5 - Pre-Call Value (Using an Agency)

**Subject:** Linear vs exponential: your choice

Hey,

Dawson here. Let's talk about the difference between good and great growth.

You're probably seeing steady growth. Monthly improvements. Predictable progress. That's good.

But here's what's really happening:

While you're perfecting 20 videos, competitors are testing 600.

While you're analyzing last month, they're already iterating.

While you're hoping for viral, they know their viral formula.

I built this infrastructure because I saw apps stuck in linear growth when exponential was possible.

**Linear Growth (Common Reality):**

- Make good content
- Some performs well
- Try to replicate
- Incremental improvement
- Predictable but slow

**Compound Growth (What's Possible):**

- Test everything possible
- Find viral patterns fast
- Scale winners 10x
- Each win builds on the last
- Exponential and predictable

The real cost isn't what you're spending. It's the compound growth you're missing every month.

Cal AI spent 18 months in linear growth. Then we added systematic testing. 30M views in 90 days. Their only regret? "We should have done this 17 months earlier."

Chart AI discovered this power. Went from hoping to knowing. 11M+ impressions in 45 days. More importantly - they can repeat it on demand.

The difference between 2x growth and 10x growth isn't effort. It's systems.

We'll break down what this means for you on the call.

- Dawson

### Email #6 - Pre-Call Value (Using an Agency)

**Subject:** The next 90 days define your category position

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

You're at an inflection point. You've proven content works. You've built a foundation. You've invested wisely.

The question is: What's next?

**Path 1: Optimization**

- Incrementally improve current approach
- Refine what you're doing
- Linear progress continues
- Solid but slow growth

**Path 2: Evolution**

- Add systematic infrastructure
- Multiply current results
- Find your viral DNA
- Exponential growth curve

In 90 days with evolution, you could have:

- 1,800+ content pieces tested
- Clear viral patterns identified
- Predictable growth engine running
- Insurmountable competitive advantage

**The Strategic Options:**

**VGC Testing Infrastructure**

- 600+ monthly tests vs typical 20-60
- Find what drives downloads
- Turn random success into repeatable system
- ROI typically within 60 days

**Micro-influencer Networks**

- 80+ authentic voices
- Build trust at scale
- Lower CAC than any paid channel
- Perfect once you know what works

**Combined Evolution**

- Discovery + trust simultaneously
- What category leaders use
- Fastest path to dominance
- Investment pays for itself through growth

Many apps start with VGC to find what works, add influencers for credibility, then amplify winners with paid ads.

Pageant added this infrastructure to their existing efforts. 9M+ impressions while reducing their workload by 70%.

The apps winning aren't working harder. They're using better systems.

Ready to evolve?

# Universal Emails (for all 3 segments)

### Email #7 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: The difference between traditional UGC and what we do**

Hey,

Dawson from EVO. Important distinction before our call.

Traditional UGC agencies make 20-30 "high-quality" videos and hope something works.

We test 600+ variations to KNOW what works.

It's the difference between guessing and data. Between hoping and engineering.

Pageant tried two UGC agencies. Pretty videos, zero growth.

We found their viral patterns in week 3. 9M+ impressions in 45 days.

The difference? Volume creates data. Data reveals patterns. Patterns drive predictable growth.

Traditional UGC is gambling. VGC is science.

- Dawson

### Email #8 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: Why more creators won’t work**

Hey,

Dawson here. Common misconception to address.

"Can't I just hire more creators to scale?"

By creator #30, you're running an agency for yourself. But the real problem?

Volume without intelligence is just noise.

When you're drowning in creator management, you can't see patterns. You're too busy in your messages app to analyze what works.

Cal AI tried this. Chaos. Then switched to infrastructure. 30M views.

The difference? They could finally SEE what worked and replicate it.

- Dawson

P.S. [See how the system actually works](https://www.notion.so/%7B%7B%20custom_values.sales_asset__offer_overview__pricing%20%7D%7D)

### Email #9- Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

Subject: **The $50K mistake apps make before product-market fit**

Hey,

Dawson here. Need to address the expensive mistake I see every week.

App founders come to me after burning through their marketing budget. Same story:

"We spent $30K on TikTok ads. Nothing."

"Hired influencers for $20K. Crickets."

"Dropped $50K testing everything. Still stuck."

Here's what's happening - they're doing the right things in the wrong order.

Think about it: Would you amplify a message before knowing if it resonates?

Would you pay for billboards before testing your tagline?

Yet that's exactly what apps do when they jump straight to paid ads.

Right now, hundreds of apps are burning $50K on Facebook ads with "professional" creative.

Beautiful videos.

Zero traction.

They're amplifying messages nobody cares about.

**Here's the sequence that actually works:**

*Months 1-3: Find what resonates*

Test 600+ organic variations for a fraction of ad costs. Discover the 3-5 formats that click. This is when you find that one angle that gets 1M+ views organically.

*Months 2-4: Build authentic trust*

Add micro-influencers showing real use cases. Not for reach - for credibility. People need to see others like them using your app.

*Months 3+: Amplify proven winners*

NOW run ads. Use content you KNOW works. Same budget, 10x results. Watch CAC (the cost to acquire a customer) drop 91%.

The expensive mistake isn't running ads. It's running ads before knowing what works.

**Here's the math right now:**

*Random ads with untested creative:*

$50K spend → 500 installs → $100 CAC → Runway burns fast

*Ads with proven viral content:*

$50K spend → 5,000 installs → $10 CAC → Sustainable growth

Same money. 10x difference. Just sequence.

But here's what kills me - agencies profit from this mistake. They'll happily take $20K/month to run ads with creative that "looks nice" but hasn't been tested.

Meanwhile, your competitor who starts with organic is finding their viral DNA for 1/10th the cost.

By the time you figure out your message, they've dominated organic, built trust through influencers, AND scaled with proven content.

The sequence isn't optional. It's how modern app growth works:

- First: Discover what resonates (organic testing)
- Second: Build authentic trust (micro-influencers)
- Third: Amplify what works (paid ads)

Skip steps = gambling. Follow sequence = predictable growth.

Your competitors know this. How much more will you spend learning the hard way?

### Email #10 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

**Subject: Volume testing doesn’t mean cheap content**

Hey,

Dawson here.

I hear this one often - "We're premium. We can't post everywhere."

The reality is, testing 600 pieces ≠ posting 600 pieces.

It means finding the 3-5 formats that represent your brand perfectly AND drive growth.

Luxury meditation app tested 600 variations. Found 3 premium formats. Now they ONLY use those 3.

Brand integrity intact. 4x growth achieved.

The brands that stay "exclusive" by avoiding content? They stay exclusively unknown.

Looking forward to our call.

- Dawson

### Email #11 - Pre-Call Value (universal Q&A)

Subject: **What if I’m already getting results?**

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

If you're already seeing results from content, you're ahead of most. Seriously.

But here's what I've learned: There's "good" growth and there's explosive growth.

**Good growth looks like:**

- Steady monthly increases
- Some viral moments
- Decent ROI
- Linear trajectory

**Explosive growth looks like:**

- Finding your viral DNA
- Predictable viral creation
- Compound momentum
- Exponential trajectory

Chart AI had good growth. 2-3 solid videos monthly. Decent downloads.

Then they added systematic testing. Hit #3 in Top Apps.

Same app. Same market. Different approach.

The question isn't "Is my current approach working?" It's "What am I leaving on the table?"

If you're getting 10K downloads monthly, could it be 100K?

If growth is 20% monthly, could it be 200%?

If you're #50 in your category, could you be #5?

Good is the enemy of great. And great is what changes everything.
