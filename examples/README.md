## 🔴 CRITICAL: B2B vs B2C Decision Tree

Based on `/docs/03-b2c-vs-b2b.md`, this single choice affects EVERYTHING:

### If B2C (Selling to Public):
- **Price Point**: $997 - $5,000
- **Psychology**: Emotional transformation
- **Volume**: 100-1000+ clients
- **Use Examples From**:
  - `/winning/analysis/b2c/`
  - B2C confirmation emails
  - B2C thank you pages
- **YouTube Videos**: Apply "Selling to Rich" differently (mass market luxury)

### If B2B (Selling to Rich/Executives):
- **Price Point**: $10,000 - $100,000+
- **Psychology**: ROI and efficiency
- **Volume**: 10-50 clients
- **Use Examples From**:
  - `/winning/analysis/b2b/`
  - B2B trust assets (Enterprise, Pipeline, etc.)
  - B2B case studies
- **YouTube Videos**: Apply "Selling to Rich" directly (executive mindset)

### Step 2: Example Selection
Based on analysis results:
- **B2C + Problem Aware** → Use B2C problem aware examples

- **B2B + Solution Aware** → Use B2B methodology examples
