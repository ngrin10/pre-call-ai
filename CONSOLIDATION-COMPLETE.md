# ✅ Forensic Analysis Consolidation Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Unified System
- **New File**: `/prompts/01-forensic-analysis-system.md`
- Combines best of both old documents
- Three clear paths based on transcript volume:
  - **Path A**: Quick Analysis (1-5 transcripts)
  - **Path B**: Batch Analysis (10+ transcripts)  
  - **Path C**: Project CLAUDE.md Generator (20+ transcripts)

### 2. Archived Old Files
- Moved `/prompts/01-forensic-analysis.md` → `/archive/prompts/`
- Moved `/0-INBOX/new-client-template/claude-md-template.md` → `/archive/`
- Added deprecation notices to both files
- Created `/archive/DEPRECATION-NOTICE.md` with migration guide

### 3. Updated All References
- ✅ `/START-HERE-MASTER-GUIDE.md` - Updated to point to new system
- ✅ `/docs/01-system-overview.md` - Updated prompt reference
- ✅ `/docs/02-workflow-guide.md` - Updated both references
- ✅ `/automation/generate-client-claude-md.sh` - Now uses new system

## Key Improvements

### Unified Awareness Framework
- Consistent definitions across all paths
- Clear spectrum: Curious → General Interest → Serious → Convicted
- Maps to Problem/Solution/Product Aware stages

### Clear Decision Tree
```
How many transcripts?
├─ 1-5 → Path A (Quick Analysis)
├─ 6-20 → Path B (Batch Analysis)
└─ 20+ → Path C (Create CLAUDE.md)
```

### Better Structure
- Same analysis framework regardless of volume
- Consistent deliverables
- Integrated examples and guidance
- Automation-ready

## How to Use

### For Quick Analysis (Most Common)
1. Open `/prompts/01-forensic-analysis-system.md`
2. Copy Path A prompt
3. Paste in Claude with transcripts
4. Get segment profiles

### For Batch Processing
1. Use Path B for orchestrator instructions
2. Process in groups of 10
3. Synthesize patterns across batches

### For Large Projects
1. Use Path C to generate custom CLAUDE.md
2. Replace variables with client specifics
3. Save in client analysis folder

## Migration Notes

- All automation scripts updated
- Old files archived for reference
- No breaking changes to workflows
- Enhanced functionality with clearer structure
