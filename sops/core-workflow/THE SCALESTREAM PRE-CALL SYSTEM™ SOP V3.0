# Decision Trees

### IF/THEN: Lead Volume

```
IF client books <20 calls/day:
  THEN ‚Üí Manual SMS follow-up acceptable
  THEN ‚Üí Personalized elements in emails

IF client books 20-50 calls/day:
  THEN ‚Üí Semi-automated with personal touches
  THEN ‚Üí Segment-based automation

IF client books 50+ calls/day:
  THEN ‚Üí Full automation required
  THEN ‚Üí Dynamic personalization only
```

### IF/THEN: Application Friction

```
IF client has high lead volume + low quality:
  THEN ‚Üí Add more qualification questions
  THEN ‚Üí Increase application length
  THEN ‚Üí Add "ready to invest" questions

IF client has low lead volume + high quality:
  THEN ‚Üí Reduce friction
  THEN ‚Üí Shorter application
  THEN ‚Üí Focus on segmentation questions only
```

### IF/THEN: B2C vs. B2B

```markdown
### IF/THEN: The Ultimate Fork in the Road

Before any other decision, every business must choose: Are you selling to the rich or to the public? This single choice defines everything - your pricing, your psychology, your entire approach.

## THE RICH VS PUBLIC DECISION MATRIX

### SELLING TO THE RICH (B2B):
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
**Characteristics:**

- Income: $250K+ personal or $10M+ business
- Mindset: Time is more valuable than money
- Decision: Logical, ROI-focused
- Research: Thorough but efficient
- Objections: "Will this save me time?"

**Your Approach:**

- Price: Premium ($10K-$100K+)
- Volume: Low (10-50 clients)
- Focus: Exceptional experience
- Selling: ROI and time-saving
- Content: Sophisticated, direct
- Emails: Fewer but highly targeted
- Trust: Through competence display

**Example Segments:**

- "7-Figure Agency Owner"
- "Corporate Executive Investor"
- "Serial Entrepreneur"

**B2B Logical Journey:**

1. Identify inefficiency
2. Quantify cost/opportunity
3. Present solution mechanics
4. Prove ROI with data
5. Urgency from competition

### SELLING TO THE PUBLIC (B2C):
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
**Characteristics:**

- Income: <$100K personal or <$1M business
- Mindset: Seeking transformation
- Decision: Emotional, then logical
- Research: Extensive, fear-driven
- Objections: "Can I afford this?"

**Your Approach:**

- Price: Accessible ($997-$5K)
- Volume: High (100-1000+ clients)
- Focus: Mass transformation
- Selling: Emotional journey
- Content: Story-driven, relatable
- Emails: High frequency education
- Trust: Through social proof

**Example Segments:**

- "Burned-Out Corporate Climber"
- "Struggling Entrepreneur"
- "Aspiring Freelancer"

**B2C Emotional Journey:**

1. Paint the pain vividly
2. Dream of transformation
3. Emotional breakthrough
4. Logical justification
5. Urgency to change life

**Critical note:** Once this decision is made, it cascades 
through every other choice in the system. B2C selling to 
public uses mass psychology. B2B selling to rich uses 
efficiency psychology.

IF client is B2C (info products, courses, coaching):
  THEN ‚Üí Use awareness-level segmentation (Problem/Solution/Product Aware)

IF client is B2B (agencies, consultants, services):
  THEN ‚Üí Use awareness + industry segmentation
  THEN ‚Üí Add company size/revenue qualifiers
```

 1. PSYCHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION

Current Situation:
‚îú‚îÄ Day-to-day pain (pull direct quotes) "I'm tired of...", "I wish I could...", "The problem is..."
‚îú‚îÄ Hidden meaning of these pain points
‚îú‚îÄ What triggered them to book this call
‚îú‚îÄ Previous attempts and why they failed
‚îú‚îÄ Hidden fears they don't explicitly state
‚îú‚îÄ The story they tell themselves
‚îú‚îÄ "Success" in their exact words
‚îî‚îÄ Timeline pressure - why now vs later

DECISION-MAKING PSYCHOLOGY:
‚îú‚îÄ Evaluation style (emotional vs logical)
‚îú‚îÄ Decision influencers (spouse, boss, peers)
‚îú‚îÄ Past buying mistakes creating skepticism
‚îú‚îÄ Risk tolerance and safety needs
‚îú‚îÄ Decision speed (fast/slow and why)

‚îú‚îÄ Trust barriers from past experiences
‚îî‚îÄ Emotional state (hopeful/skeptical/desperate)

The ONE question that matters:
"What's their experience with [solution category]?"

Every prospect exists somewhere on this spectrum when they book:
THE SPECTRUM:

|-----------|------------|----------------|--------------|
Curious Interest -> General Interest -> Serious to Buy -> Convicted
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE:

60% book at "Curious"
30% book at "General Interest"
8% book at "Serious Interest"
2% book at "Convicted"

WHERE YOU NEED THEM FOR THE SALE:

Minimum: "Serious Interest"
Ideal: "Convicted"

YOUR JOB:
Move them up 2-3 levels between booking and showing up.

As you analyze calls, mark where each prospect started:

**Curious Indicators:**
- "I just wanted to see what this was about"
- "I saw your ad and thought I'd learn more"
- Vague about their goals
- No specific questions prepared
- Haven't researched alternatives

**General Interest Indicators:**
- "I've been thinking about [solution] for a while"
- Some research done
- Basic questions about process
- Comparing to 1-2 alternatives
- Timeline: "someday soon"

**Serious Interest Indicators:**
- Specific questions prepared
- Clear on their problem
- Actively comparing options
- Timeline: "In the next 30-60 days"
- Budget conversation ready

**Convicted Indicators:**
- "I'm ready to get started"
- Only question is logistics
- Already sold themselves
- Timeline: "ASAP"
- How do I pay?

#### Why This Matters

Your entire pre-call system is about spectrum movement:

1. **Curious ‚Üí General Interest:** Requires education about the opportunity
2. **General ‚Üí Serious:** Requires differentiation and proof
3. **Serious ‚Üí Convicted:** Requires urgency and risk reversal

If you treat everyone like they're convicted (short, logistical emails), the 98% who aren't will ghost.

If you treat everyone like they're curious (heavy education), the 2% who are convicted will get annoyed.

This is why segmentation is everything.

- "Never heard of it" ‚Üí PROBLEM AWARE
- "Know it exists, exploring" ‚Üí SOLUTION AWARE  
- "Comparing specific tools" ‚Üí PRODUCT AWARE

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Revenue level

TERTIARY LAYER: Size (B2B only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Small
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Medium
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Large

**Segment Profiles Template:**

Segment Name: [Memorable, specific name]

Find anything common at all between the individual call's "üîç Master Forensic Analysis Prompt" and group them up to get extremely specific per each segment
```

### **For EACH segment, create:**

**Step 2: Develop Pain Point Messaging**

```
Template:
- Current State: "You're [specific situation]"
- Hidden Pain: "Which really means [deeper issue]"
- Dream State: "You want [specific outcome]"

Example:
- Current: "You're a lawyer with 47 voice memos of song ideas"
- Hidden: "Which means you feel like a creative failure"
- Dream: "You want to see your name on Spotify"
```

**Step 3: Develop Objection Reframe Messaging**

```
Template:
- Surface Objection: "I don't have time"
- Real Meaning: "I'm afraid I'll fail again"
- Reframe: "That's why everything's recorded - work at 11pm if you want"
```

**Step 4: Develop Trust Building Messaging**

```
Template:
- Their Fear: "[Specific doubt]"
- Our Proof: "[Specific evidence]"
- Story Match: "[Similar client story]"
```

**Step 5: Validate segments**

```
Checklist:

‚ñ° Each segment represents 15%+ of leads
‚ñ° Segments are clearly different
‚ñ° You have specific quotes for each
‚ñ° Their problems are distinct
‚ñ° Solutions would be different
```

**Step 6: Save segment findings**

```
Save full breakdown of each segment as: "Audience_Segment_Profiles" in project knowledge
```

### **üü°** **JOINT: Segment Review Call**

**Step 1: Prepare presentation**

```
Create simple slides showing:
- Segment name & percentage
- Key characteristics
- Example quotes
- Recommended approach
```

**Step 2: Conduct review (30 min)**

```
Agenda:

1. Present each segment (3 min each)

"Do these segments match who you talk to?"
"What percentage is each segment?"
"Which segment is highest value?"
"What did we miss?"

2. Client validates: "Yes, I talk to these people!"
3. Prioritize which segment to focus on first
4. Get any missing context
```

**Step 3: Document decisions**

```
Copy the call transcript + refer back to the "Segment_Analysis" recap into Claude to create a slack message:

"Subject: Your 3 Customer Segments - Confirmed

[Name],

Here are your confirmed segments:

SEGMENT 1: [Name] - [X%]
The [description] who [key characteristic]
Main message: [One sentence]

# PHASE 3: CONTENT CREATION

*Timeline: Day 5-6*

## 3.1 Value Email Sequences

### **üü¢ AGENCY: Write All Value Email Sequences Journey**

### Step 1: Upload Pre-Call Email SOPs into Claude (per segment)

Reference these SOPs from project knowledge:

- "SOP: Creating Segmented Pre-Call Email Sequences for WSI / B2C"
- "WSI/B2C Email Strategy - Complete Writing Guide"
- HMC Pre-Call Email SOP
- The Email-Value Strategy SOP
    
    You've mapped out your email and SMS sequences. Now it's time to understand the full arsenal required to move someone from "curious" to "convicted" before their call.
    
    ### The Email-Value Strategy‚Ñ¢
    
    This isn't just about emails. When someone books a call, they enter what we call the "research danger zone" - the 24-72 hours where they'll either build massive desire or talk themselves out of showing up.
    
    ### The Psychology Behind Volume:
    
    Think about your own behavior when considering a high-ticket purchase. You don't watch one video and decide. You binge. You research. You look for red flags. You seek confirmation.
    
    By providing 50+ pieces of content, you're not overwhelming them - you're feeding their natural research hunger with YOUR framing rather than letting them find random information (or competitor content) on their own.
    
    **Implementation Timeline:**
    
    - Week 1: Create first 10 short form pieces
    - Week 2: Create first 5 long form pieces
    - Week 3: Create next 20 short form pieces
    - Week 4: Complete remaining content
    - Ongoing: Add 5-10 new pieces monthly
    
    Remember People don‚Äôt show up because the company sent ZERO educational content. He researched on his own, found negative information, and ghosted. Don't let this happen to your clients.
    
    ### **Your Content Arsenal Requirements:**
    
    For EACH segment, create:
    
    **SHORT FORM CONTENT (30-50 pieces):**
    
    - 10-15 testimonial clips (30-60 seconds)
    - 10-15 objection crushers (addressing specific doubts)
    - 10-15 transformation stories (before/after)
    - 5-10 mechanism explanations (how it works)
    
    **LONG FORM CONTENT (15-30 pieces):**
    
    - 5-10 case study videos (5-10 minutes)
    - 5-10 educational deep dives
    - 3-5 "day in the life" walkthroughs
    - 2-3 comprehensive proof compilations
    
    **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:**
    
    - Confirmation page: 3-5 videos minimum
    - Email sequences: 1-2 videos per email
    - Retargeting ads: All 30-50 short form pieces
    - SMS: Links to most relevant 2-3 pieces

### Step 2: Write Pre-Call Value Email Sequences (per segment)

```
Using the email sequence SOP in project knowledge, create a complete
pre-call email sequence for each segment.

Refer to these SOPs to make the flow 10x better.

Context from analysis:
- Awareness level: [Problem/Solution/Product]
- Core struggle: [From analysis]
- Main objection: [From analysis]
- Urgency triggers: [From analysis]
- Success vision: [From analysis]

Booking window: [24/48/72 hours]
Current show rate: [X%]

We want to create 7-10 emails following the framework:
1. Confirmation (immediate)
2. Authority builder (2-4 hours)
3. Education deep-dive (Day 1 PM)
4. Social proof (Day 2 AM)
5. Objection crusher (Day 2 PM)
6. Vision caster (Day before AM)
7. Urgency builder (Day before PM)
8-10. Logistics reminders

For each email provide:
- 3 subject line options
- Complete email body
- Psychology behind it
- Timing recommendation

**Critical Implementation Notes:**

1. Each email builds on the previous - never send them out of order
2. Word count increases trust - aim for 800-2000 words
3. Include 1-2 assets per email (video, PDF, case study)
4. Personal stories outperform general statistics
5. End each email with curiosity for the next

**The Psychology Behind Each Flow:**

- Problem Aware: Education ‚Üí Possibility ‚Üí Urgency
- Solution Aware: Validation ‚Üí Differentiation ‚Üí Proof
- Product Aware: Confidence ‚Üí ROI ‚Üí Excitement

These aren't just emails. They're a psychological journey that matches exactly where your prospect is mentally and walks them to where they need to be for the sale.

## 3.2 Reminder Email Sequences

### **üü¢ AGENCY: Write All Reminder Email Sequences Journey**

### Step 1: Upload Pre-Call Email SOPs into Claude (per segment)

Reference these SOPs from project knowledge:

- HSU Pre-Call Reminder Sequence
    
    ---
    
    ## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM VALUE EMAILS:
    
    1. **Tone**: Friendly and logistical vs educational and transformative
    2. **Length**: Short and scannable vs value-dense and meaty
    3. **Purpose**: Get them to show up vs pre-sell and educate
    4. **Content**: Times, links, light benefits vs deep psychology and teaching
    5. **Sender**: Mix of Ian, Closer, and Company vs all from Ian
    
    These work because they:
    
    - Feel like natural check-ins, not automation
    - Build anticipation without overwhelming
    - Include personality without being unprofessional
    - Give clear logistics without being boring
    - Create accountability without pressure
    
    The value emails do the heavy lifting of education and transformation. These just make sure they show up ready to take the next step.
    
    P.S. Have one of your unfinished songs handy. We might workshop it together to show you exactly where you're getting stuck.

- "[WSI] Value vs Reminder Emails"
- Value-Dense Email Revolution
    
    <aside>
    üö®
    
    ### CRITICAL MINDSET SHIFT: The Value-Dense Email Revolution
    
    Before you write a single email, understand this fundamental truth that separates million-dollar months from mediocre results:
    
    **"People seek information when they're buying. When you withhold information for the sales call, you dramatically increase the odds they don't show up."**
    
    Here's what changes everything:
    
    **Frequency Revolution**
    
    - Old thinking: 1-2 emails per day maximum
    - New reality: Up to 6 emails per day (every 2 hours, 6am-6pm)
    - The test: If open rates don't drop, keep increasing
    - Most businesses: Send anywhere from 9am-9pm every other hour
    
    **Open Rate Reality Check**
    
    - What you think is good: 30-50%
    - What we actually see: 50-70% with value-dense emails
    - The paradox: MORE emails = HIGHER open rates (when done right)
    
    **Word Count Transformation**
    
    - Typical reminder email: 50-150 words
    - Value-dense email: "Hundreds if not low thousands" of words
    - Each email: Answers questions that would be asked on the call
    - Result: Shorter sales cycles, more PIFs (paid in full)
    
    **The Million-Dollar Test**
    Start with your current frequency. Add one more email per day. Watch your open rates:
    
    - If they maintain or increase ‚Üí Add another
    - If they drop significantly ‚Üí You found your limit
    - Sweet spot for most: 4-6 emails per day
    
    Remember: These aren't "Hey, don't forget your call!" emails. These are complete educational assets that happen to be delivered via email.
    
    ### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Forbidden Elements in Email Sequences
    
    Before you write a single word, burn these phrases from your vocabulary:
    
    **THE NEVER LIST:**
    
    ‚ùå "Homework" or "Required reading"
    ‚úÖ Instead: "Valuable resource" or "Helpful guide"
    
    ‚ùå "Make sure you show up"
    ‚úÖ Instead: "Looking forward to our conversation"
    
    ‚ùå "Don't forget your call"
    ‚úÖ Instead: "Your transformation session details"
    
    ‚ùå Generic motivation: "You can do this!"
    ‚úÖ Instead: Specific encouragement based on their situation
    
    ‚ùå Fake urgency: "Only 3 spots left!"
    ‚úÖ Instead: Real urgency with explanation
    
    ‚ùå Income claims: "Make $10K in 30 days guaranteed"
    ‚úÖ Instead: "Average client results after 90 days"
    
    ‚ùå Shame tactics: "If you don't show up, you don't want success"
    ‚úÖ Instead: Understanding and reengagement
    
    ‚ùå Begging energy: "Please please show up"
    ‚úÖ Instead: Confident value delivery
    
    WHY THESE KILL CONVERSIONS:
    
    "Homework" ‚Üí Creates obligation instead of opportunity
    "Make sure" ‚Üí Sounds desperate and controlling
    Generic motivation ‚Üí Shows you don't understand them
    Fake urgency ‚Üí Breeds distrust if discovered
    Income claims ‚Üí Legal liability and skepticism
    Shame ‚Üí Creates resentment, not commitment
    
    Remember: Every word either builds trust or destroys it. Choose wisely.

    ## **PART 1: THE FOUNDATION - WHY THIS MATTERS**
    
    ### **The Hidden Revenue Leak**
    
    Most companies focus on getting more leads while ignoring the massive revenue leak happening between booking and showing up. Here's what's really happening:
    
    - **40-60% of booked calls don't show up**
    - **Of those who show, 70% arrive unprepared and skeptical**
    - **Sales reps waste the first 20 minutes explaining basics**
    - **3-5 call cycles when it should be 1-2 calls**
    
    **The Math:** If you book 100 calls monthly and close 20%, that's 20 new customers. Fix the leak (get to 70% show rate + better preparation), and you get 35 customers. That's 75% revenue growth without more leads.
    
    ### **What We Learned From The Masters**
    
    **Jeremy Haynes (Selling to the Rich):**
    
    - Sophisticated buyers want peer-to-peer conversation, not vendor education
    - Answer complex questions beforehand so closers handle strategy, not basics
    - Business owners hate being talked down to or over-explained
    
    **Ravi (Thank You Page Psychology):**
    
    - People consume content in the 72 hours after booking more than before
    - Simple consumption path (Step 1, 2, 3) beats information overload
    - Video completion rates drop dramatically with too many options
    
    **Ryan (Pre-Call Optimization):**
    
    - The sale happens between booking and showing up, not during the call
    - Different sophistication levels need different preparation
    - Pre-qualified prospects close faster and at higher rates
    
    **Matt Gray (Authentic Communication):**
    
    - Natural conversation beats polished marketing speak
    - Share experience, don't pitch services
    - "Right?" and conversational connectors make it human
    
    ### **The Micro-Commitment Psychology**
    
    Every prospect goes through 9 mental stages before buying:
    
    1. I'm not where I want to be
    2. I have a problem
    3. I understand my problem
    4. I want to solve this problem
    5. [Your solution] can help
    6. I want [your solution], not alternatives
    7. I can't do this myself
    8. I need professional help
    9. I want help from [your company]
    
    **Key Insight:** Different segments enter at different stages. Your thank you page must meet them where they are, not where you think they should be.

[Sales-Asset-Framework-Template.pdf](attachment:54ebc3d1-ba59-492a-9414-b7e5e79bd217:Sales-Asset-Framework-Template.pdf)

### **AGENCY: Write SOLUTION AWARE VERSION (Shortened):**

```jsx
10-15 pages, starts at Section 5
- Skip education (they know problem)
- Heavy on mechanism
- More comparison focused
- Extra social proof
```

### **AGENCY: Write PRODUCT AWARE VERSION (Pitch Deck):**

```jsx
7-10 slides, ultra-focused

### **CLIENT: Record Thank You Video**

## 3.6 Trust Assets

### **AGENCY: Create Trust Assets**

There's a critical distinction most businesses miss: Sales Assets close transactions faster, while Trust Assets remove resistance incrementally. You need both, deployed strategically.

**Reference this SOP from project knowledge:**

- "SOP: Creating Trust Building and Sales Assets for WSI Pre-Call Sequences"

SALES ASSETS (Close Faster):

- Purpose: Create urgency and decision
- Examples: Limited-time bonuses, guarantees, payment plans
- Psychology: "Act now because..."
- Timing: Deploy late in sequence

TRUST ASSETS (Remove Resistance):

- Purpose: Chip away at skepticism
- Examples: Industry reports, comparisons, methodologies
- Psychology: "This is real because..."
- Timing: Deploy early and throughout

```
Trust Asset Selection by Objection:

Based on the core objection for each segment, choose ONE primary trust asset:

"Is this real?" ‚Üí Industry Credibility Report

10-15 pages of market data
Third-party validation
Industry trends supporting your solution
Regulatory/compliance information
Media mentions and partnerships

"I've been burned" ‚Üí Comparison Guide

Side-by-side with what failed before
"Why this is different" framework
Specific mechanism breakdowns
Failure analysis of other approaches
Protection and guarantee details

"Can I do this?" ‚Üí Success Pathway Tool

Self-assessment scorecard
Success predictor based on their answers
Clear timeline with milestones
Prerequisite checker
Confidence-building exercises
```

### The Modern Trust Asset Framework

**Understanding the Distinction:**

**Create 1-2 assets per segment:**

```
TRUST ASSET PROMPT:

Create a [GUIDE/CHECKLIST/REPORT] for [SEGMENT NAME] that handles
their main objection: [OBJECTION].

Asset title: "The [Their Role]'s Guide to [Specific Outcome]"

Structure:
1. Cover page with compelling title
2. "I know exactly where you are" opening
3. The real problem (reframe their issue)
4. Why traditional solutions fail them
5. The new approach that works
6. Success stories from people like them
7. Your unique methodology
8. Implementation roadmap
9. Common mistakes to avoid
10. Next steps (show up prepared)

Length: 8-10 pages
Design: Scannable, mobile-friendly
Tool: Gamma.app or Canva

Include:
- Industry statistics
- 3-4 mini case studies
- Visual framework/process
- Checklist or worksheet
- Clear call-to-action

**Asset Examples:**

For Problem Aware:

- "The Hidden $30B Industry Report"
- "5 Signs You're Ready for a Career Pivot"

For Solution Aware:

- "Sales Training Comparison Guide 2024"
- "Why Most Programs Fail (And What Works)"

For Product Aware:

```

### **JOINT: Asset Review**

- Confirms language matches their brand
- Approves before moving to tech build
```
