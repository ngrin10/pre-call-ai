🔍 Segment Deep-Dive — Describe Your 3-5 Prospect Types

Why this matters:

• Tailored confirmation pages, emails, and SMS convert up to 30 % more when they speak to a prospect’s exact fears and proof triggers.

• Sales-call transcripts give us language; this exercise reveals the gaps transcripts miss because it forces you to think through each buyer’s decision lens.

• Investing five thoughtful minutes here saves weeks of “why are they ghosting?” later.

How to fill it:

1. Think of the 3-5 distinct kinds of people who book calls (roles, budgets, mindsets).

2. For each one, copy the format below and overwrite the placeholders.

3. Bullet answers are fine—honesty beats perfect.
• Name / Nickname:

• 1-sentence pain they blurt out:

• First question they always ask:

• How they found you (first touch point, been following your content for a while, referral, price shopping, etc):

• Other questions they ask (and your quick answers):

• Common misconception about what we do:

• Objection that stalls them:

• If they saw this one proof / success story, they’d buy:

• Urgency level (1 = meh, 5 = “yesterday”):

• Skepticism level (1 = easy believer, 5 = show me receipts):
Respondent’s answer
How many recent call recordings do you have access to?
(Respondents can select as many as they like)
Upload recent sales call transcripts (wins & fails) in a Google Doc
🚀 No transcripts? Here’s the 2-minute fix

1. Download the audio or video file from Zoom, GHL, Gong, etc.

2. Drop it into any free auto-transcription site (e.g. Otter.ai, Notta, Riverside Text-to-Speech).

3. Copy the plain text into a Google Doc.

4. Name the doc Call-Date-Outcome (example: 2025-05-14-Lost-BudgetPushback).

5. Paste the share-link below.

(The more transcripts, the better)
