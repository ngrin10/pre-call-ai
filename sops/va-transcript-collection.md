# üéØ VA Transcript Collection SOP

## **What You're Helping With**
Your client just hired us to improve their sales call show rates. We need to analyze their sales calls to understand their buyers. Your job is to collect these transcripts so we can find patterns.

## **The Goal**
Collect 20+ recent sales call transcripts that show how prospects talk, what they object to, and why they buy (or don't buy).

---

## **Step-by-Step Process**

### **Step 1: Understand What Makes a Good Transcript**

**‚úÖ INCLUDE these calls:**
- ‚úÖ Full conversations (30+ minutes ideal)
- ‚úÖ Recent calls (last 90 days)
- ‚úÖ Mix of outcomes (some closed, some lost)
- ‚úÖ Calls where prospect talks a lot
- ‚úÖ Calls with objections and questions

**‚ùå SKIP these calls:**
- ‚ùå Super short calls (under 15 minutes)
- ‚ùå No-shows or reschedules
- ‚ùå Internal team calls
- ‚ùå Follow-up/check-in calls
- ‚ùå Calls where prospect barely speaks

### **Step 2: Create the Google Doc**

**Title**: `"[Company Name] - Sales Call Transcripts for Analysis"`

### **Step 3: As You Copy Each Transcript**

For each call, make a quick judgment:

```
=== TRANSCRIPT 1 ===
Date: [Date from recording]
Outcome: [Won/Lost/Still in Pipeline]
Length: [Duration]
Quality: [Good/Fair/Poor]
Why this call matters: [One sentence - e.g., "Prospect explained exactly why they didn't trust agencies"]

[Full transcript here]
```

### **Step 4: Quality Control**

After every 5 transcripts, ask yourself:
- Am I seeing different types of buyers?
- Are prospects explaining their problems?
- Can I hear objections and concerns?
- Is there variety in outcomes?

**If too many are similar, find different ones.**

### **Step 5: Quick Summary**

At the top of the doc, after collecting all transcripts:

```
SUMMARY FOR ANALYSIS TEAM:
- Total transcripts collected: [#]
- Date range: [Earliest] to [Latest]
- Outcome breakdown: [X Won, Y Lost, Z Pipeline]
- Common patterns noticed: [2-3 things you observed]
- Any concerns: [Missing certain types, audio issues, etc.]
```

## **Red Flag Transcripts (Still Include, But Flag)**

üö© **Price-Only Calls**: Prospect only cares about cost  
**Note**: "Price-focused entire call"

üö© **Wrong Fit Calls**: Obviously not ideal customer  
**Note**: "Seems like wrong target market"

üö© **Defensive Prospects**: Closed off, won't engage  
**Note**: "Prospect very guarded"

üö© **Tech Issues**: Bad audio, missing parts  
**Note**: "Audio cuts out multiple times"

---

## **Time Estimate**
- **2-3 minutes per transcript** to copy and tag
- **20 transcripts = ~1 hour total**
- **Finding good transcripts** might take extra time

---

## **If You Get Stuck**

### **Can't find enough good transcripts?**
- Check different date ranges
- Ask sales team for their "most interesting" calls
- Look for calls that were almost closed but lost

### **Transcripts seem too similar?**
- Look for different sales reps
- Check different lead sources
- Find different industries/company sizes

### **Not sure if a call is worth including?**
**Include it!** Better to have too many than too few.

---

## **What NOT to Do**

‚ùå **Don't analyze or summarize** the calls  
‚ùå **Don't decide what segments** exist  
‚ùå **Don't remove "boring" parts**  
‚ùå **Don't fix grammar** or clean up speech  
‚ùå **Don't categorize** beyond basic outcome  
‚ùå **Don't spend more than 3 minutes** per transcript  

**Your job is COLLECTION, not ANALYSIS.**  
We have specialized tools for the analysis part.

## **Quality Examples**

### **‚úÖ GOOD Example**
```
=== TRANSCRIPT 5 ===
Date: 2024-01-15
Outcome: Lost
Length: 45 minutes
Quality: Good
Why this call matters: Prospect spent 20 minutes explaining bad experience with previous agency

Rep: What's prompting you to look for help with content?
Prospect: Honestly, we got burned pretty bad by our last agency. They promised the world and delivered generic stuff that didn't convert. I'm skeptical of anyone claiming they can help with content marketing...
[Continue full conversation]
```

### **‚ùå POOR Example**
```
=== TRANSCRIPT 8 ===
Date: 2024-01-20
Outcome: Rescheduled
Length: 8 minutes
Quality: Poor
Why this call matters: Just scheduling, no real conversation

Rep: Hi John, thanks for hopping on.
Prospect: Actually, can we reschedule? I'm in back-to-back meetings.
Rep: Of course, what works better for you?
[Short scheduling conversation]
```
