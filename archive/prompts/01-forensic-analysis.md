## PROMPT

I need you to conduct a forensic analysis of my sales conversations to identify distinct prospect segments and create a hyper-personalized pre-call nurture system. 

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**BACKGROUND CONTEXT** (in project knowledge):
├─ Target audience, offer, pricing, current stats, objections, etc: "Onboarding_Responses", "Onboarding Call"

**MATERIALS PROVIDED**:
├─ Sales Transcripts: "Sales_Transcripts"
├─ Results: "Case Studies"
├─ Current marketing materials: "Marketing Asset_name", "Marketing Asset_name", "Marketing Asset_name"
└─ Testimonials and case studies

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🔍 1. PSYCHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION

**Current Situation:**
├─ Day-to-day pain (pull direct quotes) "I'm tired of...", "I wish I could...", "The problem is..."
├─ Hidden meaning of these pain points
├─ What triggered them to book this call
├─ Previous attempts and why they failed
├─ Hidden fears they don't explicitly state
├─ The story they tell themselves
├─ "Success" in their exact words
└─ Timeline pressure - why now vs later

**DECISION-MAKING PSYCHOLOGY:**
├─ Evaluation style (emotional vs logical)
├─ Decision influencers (spouse, boss, peers)
├─ Past buying mistakes creating skepticism
├─ Risk tolerance and safety needs
├─ Decision speed (fast/slow and why)
├─ Proof preferences (data, stories, authority)
└─ Investment comfort and money mindset

**AWARENESS JOURNEY STAGE:**
├─ Specific rabbit holes they've explored
├─ Competitors looked at and rejected (why)
├─ Misconceptions about the solution
├─ Knowledge gaps preventing progress
├─ Trust barriers from past experiences
└─ Emotional state (hopeful/skeptical/desperate)

### The ONE question that matters:
**"What's their experience with [solution category]?"**

Every prospect exists somewhere on this spectrum when they book:

**THE SPECTRUM:**

```
|-----------|------------|----------------|--------------|
Curious Interest -> General Interest -> Serious to Buy -> Convicted
```

**WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE:**
- 60% book at "Curious"
- 30% book at "General Interest"
- 8% book at "Serious Interest"
- 2% book at "Convicted"

**WHERE YOU NEED THEM FOR THE SALE:**
- Minimum: "Serious Interest"
- Ideal: "Convicted"

**YOUR JOB:**
Move them up 2-3 levels between booking and showing up.

### Spectrum Indicators in Your Transcripts

As you analyze calls, mark where each prospect started:

**Curious Indicators:**
- "I just wanted to see what this was about"
- "I saw your ad and thought I'd learn more"
- Vague about their goals
- No specific questions prepared
- Haven't researched alternatives

**General Interest Indicators:**
- "I've been thinking about [solution] for a while"
- Some research done
- Basic questions about process
- Comparing to 1-2 alternatives
- Timeline: "someday soon"

**Serious Interest Indicators:**
- Specific questions prepared
- Clear on their problem
- Actively comparing options
- Timeline: "In the next 30-60 days"
- Budget conversation ready

**Convicted Indicators:**
- "I'm ready to get started"
- Only question is logistics
- Already sold themselves
- Timeline: "ASAP"
- How do I pay?

#### Why This Matters

Your entire pre-call system is about spectrum movement:

1. **Curious → General Interest:** Requires education about the opportunity
2. **General → Serious:** Requires differentiation and proof
3. **Serious → Convicted:** Requires urgency and risk reversal

If you treat everyone like they're convicted (short, logistical emails), the 98% who aren't will ghost.

If you treat everyone like they're curious (heavy education), the 2% who are convicted will get annoyed.

This is why segmentation is everything.

**Awareness Level Mapping:**
- "Never heard of it" → **PROBLEM AWARE**
- "Know it exists, exploring" → **SOLUTION AWARE**  
- "Comparing specific tools" → **PRODUCT AWARE**

## 🔍 2. LANGUAGE FORENSICS

**PAIN ARTICULATION:**
