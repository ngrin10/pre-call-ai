## Stage 1: Pre-Call Inputs

### Onboarding Form (`COMPLETE-ONBOARDING-FORM.md`)
Client provides:
- Basic metrics (show rate, close rate, etc.)
- Business information
- Current positioning
- Pain points

**Output**: Structured data in form responses

---

## Stage 2: Discovery Call

### Discovery Call Guide (`discovery-call-guide.md`)
You extract:
- Hidden objections
- Psychological patterns
- Competitive intelligence
- Positioning opportunities

**Output**: Call transcript + notes

---

## Stage 3: Consolidation Hub

### 📁 `/03-marketing-materials/` (The Central Hub)

This is where EVERYTHING gets organized:

```
03-marketing-materials/
├── 00-client-insights/              # NEW: Consolidated insights
│   └── client-insights-consolidation.md
├── 01-email-sequences/              # Current email analysis
├── 02-sms-templates/                # Current SMS analysis
├── 03-sales-pages/                  # Current page copy
├── 04-vsl-content/                  # Current video scripts
├── 05-social-proof/                 # Available proof
├── 06-positioning-docs/             # Brand positioning
├── 07-offer-sheets/                 # Pricing & packages
├── 08-performance-data/             # Metrics & analytics
├── 09-faqs-objections/              # Objection handling
└── 10-service-breakdown/            # What they deliver
```

**Key Innovation**: The `00-client-insights/` folder consolidates:
- Onboarding form answers
- Discovery call insights
- Into one organized document that feeds everything else

---

## Stage 4: Automation Processing

### Deep Research Scripts Pull From Consolidation:

```bash
# deep-research.sh reads from:
/03-marketing-materials/00-client-insights/client-insights-consolidation.md
/03-marketing-materials/06-positioning-docs/
/03-marketing-materials/08-performance-data/

# generate-content.sh uses:
/03-marketing-materials/00-client-insights/ (for personalization)
/03-marketing-materials/09-faqs-objections/ (for objection handling)
```

### The Flow:
1. Scripts read the consolidated insights
2. Apply the right examples based on B2B/B2C
3. Reference correct YouTube psychology
4. Generate awareness-specific content

---

## Stage 5: Content Generation

### Content Creation Uses Everything:

```
Consolidated Insights (00)
    + Current Materials (01-10)
    + Winning Examples (/examples/)
    + YouTube Psychology
    = Personalized Content
```

---

## 🎯 Key Integration Points

### 1. Form → Insights Document
When onboarding form is completed:
```
Copy answers → Paste into client-insights-consolidation.md → Section 1
```

### 2. Call → Insights Document
After discovery call:
```
Extract insights → Add to client-insights-consolidation.md → Section 2
```

### 3. Insights → Automation
When running analysis:
```
deep-research.sh → Reads from consolidated insights → Generates analysis
```

### 4. Analysis → Content
When creating content:
```
Analysis results + Examples + Psychology → Awareness-specific content
```

2. **Automation Ready**: Scripts know where to find data
3. **Scalable**: Same process for every client
4. **Traceable**: Can see how insights → content

---

## 🔧 Automation Commands

```bash
# After consolidating insights:
./automation/deep-research.sh [client-name]

# After research completes:
./automation/generate-content.sh [client-name] [awareness-level]
