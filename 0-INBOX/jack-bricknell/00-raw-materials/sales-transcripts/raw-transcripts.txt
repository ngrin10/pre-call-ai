1: "This meeting is being recorded with our team without having to hire so the promise of say
eight to 12 meetings a month you know that's one person depending on pricing and what y'all
could offer it could be an option for us so we just wanted to learn more yeah for sure I mean we
better be good at cold emails if you know if we're gonna offer it as a service so I'm glad that glad
that he liked it yeah I took a little bit of a look at Kanji you guys are in the MDM space device
management I'm interested to hear a little bit about sort of like the value proposition of the
company and you know services and everything else and then I will let you know how I think
potentially we could we could help with emails yeah sure so it's pretty simple you know if you
have a Mac device we put an agent on it to get to
Allan Ramsay
Secure and lock the device. things like, hey, like there's a new Chrome update. We'll update that
for them. Hey, your passwords need to be aligned with how you want them secure, depending
on like the industry.
And we'll do that through the agent. We'll push the device when it's like onboarded so that it's
like set up instantaneously instead of the employee having to do it by themselves.
So long story short, we basically secure Apple devices for companies. We're Apple specific.
We're reaching out to like IT managers, IT directors.
A lot of the time, especially in our like ICP, like 200 employees plus, they already have
something in, they already have something like a Jamf or a Mosul.
And so we're trying to displace the current NBM. And then I'd also say there's like a legacy play
of like Jamf is like Salesforce.
It's the known place. You don't lose your job if you buy Jamf. And so there's definitely a
reluctance to switch over to something, especially when the people who were above them, say
like the director of VP, were growing up on Jamf.
They've never actually had hands-on experience with Kanji. So they're also reluctant to do it.
And then, you know, anytime you switch over and do change management, that can be pretty
crazy too.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, a headache to switch. What kind of makes that switch worth it?
Allan Ramsay
Yeah, sure. It's basically like time saved and ease of use.
Jack Bricknell
Got it.
Allan Ramsay
The easiest way to put it.
Jack Bricknell
Cool. So basically, people are using the old solution, especially at these larger companies,
which is the ICP. They're using the old solution, Jamf.
I recall that name because I was doing a bit of research. I saw them pop up. And you can come
in, have a more efficient solution.
That can save them X amount of time, and that is worth making the switch. Is there any other
really key selling points?
And are you guys, by the way, are you guys running any outbound email outreach at the
moment?
Allan Ramsay
Yeah, so I'm trying to do something, I'm doing it with Apollo right now. Basically looking at like
their workflows and then trying to find target contacts and finding sequences.
It's like, it's frustrating because we get opens, we get replies, they're not great replies. A lot of
like bounced emails, as you know, like warming up an inbox is hard.
And so that's kind of like what we're running into right now is like, what does it look like as you're
building this out?
But yeah, that's already happening. I what I am seeing is like, we are driving people to website
visits, right?
So like, I think like 10% of the emails that are the- Contacts that I've been sending this out to,
they're actually going to the website.
So that tells me that we're landing somewhere, it's just people are unafraid, they don't want to
respond, and I get it, it's a sales email, so I'm trying to figure out how to get more responses.
Jack Bricknell
Yep, yep, yep, yep. Okay, so using Apollo, one thing you're going to want to do with all Apollo
emails, so, for instance, we use tools that, like, we don't use Apollo to send because it's not
ideal, we have, like, platforms like Instantly.ai or Smartly.ai that are specifically built for cold
email sending, so that's something you might want to look into.
And then, for bounced emails, you're going to want to use a tool, Million Verifier, so Apollo
claims that they have verified emails, that isn't entirely true, because we run all our lists through
Million Verifier.
Verifier separately, you're going to find around like 5% are dead emails, and then like 20 to 30%
are catch all.
And so that's what will lead to like a high bounce rate. So if you're seeing bounce rates over like
3%, or especially over 5%, that's pretty unhealthy.
you want to make sure that you verify it through Million Verifier.
Allan Ramsay
I've heard this from a couple of people that I've reached out to. With Million Verifier, is that
something I can connect into Apollo, or do you like download the list to Apollo, run it through
Million Verifier, and then bring it back into Apollo?
Jack Bricknell
Typically download the list and dropping it in there. We don't use, I don't know if Apollo has an
API integration, it might, but it's fairly easy to just drop the list in there and pop it in.
You can get a million, million Verifier credits for like 300 bucks. I think it's like 389. And then you
just won't, you know, you won't need it for like three.
More and more. As far as, yeah, a lot of people will visit your website when they see it. That is a
pretty good sign of interest, although a lot of people just want to check out who is this person.
Do you know how many emails, roughly, you're sending on a daily basis and what your
response rates are, like roughly?
Allan Ramsay
We're sending anywhere, so for those two people, we have 15 inboxes set up for each of them
across two domains, and we're sending anywhere from like 750 to 1300.
So probably about 50 emails per inbox per day.
Jack Bricknell
Gotcha.
Allan Ramsay
What are your thoughts on that?
Jack Bricknell
Are the domains you're sending from, are you sending from kanji.io or?
Allan Ramsay
A different one. So we use the kanji.io for like one inbox, just because that's a good one. And
the other one is through the other domain try kanji.
Jack Bricknell
Okay, so you guys have kind of the look-like setup. I'll tell you what we do, and then I'll tell you
what I'd suggest.
So we typically send 15 per day per inbox. We set up three inboxes per domain, and so we go a
ton of different domains.
And you have the idea right. It's like tryKanji.io, tryKanjiSoftware.io, that kind of thing.
Allan Ramsay
How many domains did you say you had?
Jack Bricknell
Sorry?
Allan Ramsay
How many domains did you say you had?
Jack Bricknell
I missed that. So you do three inboxes per domain, and so we went to ascending volume like a
baseline of like the smallest setup we ever do is like 2,000 emails a day.
So like for this, I kind of see this as more of a, well, I'll get to that later. But for- I
I would say you want to probably triple the amount of volume just because email is kind of a
volume game, and if you're talking about IT people at 200-plus employee US companies, you've
got a pretty big TAM to attack, so having a volume that high is not a problem.
15 per inbox per day, we used to be able to do 50. Nowadays, you're going to start to have
deliverability issues if you're sending that much volume per inbox, it can be a big problem.
Using the kanji.io domain, you might have not as big of a problem because probably internally
you're sending a ton of emails, so that can kind of be masked.
But using a fresh domain like try kanji.io, maybe that you've warmed up for two weeks, you'll
eventually start having issues if you're still sending 50 per inbox.
Do you know what your reply rates are right now?
Allan Ramsay
About one. let's say now. 그러면 we'll And a half percent, depending on the sequence.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. And a lot of those are probably out of office as well.
Allan Ramsay
I would say 75% are like actual replies.
Jack Bricknell
Okay.
Allan Ramsay
75% are out of office.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. Are most of the replies, I mean, with the standard with cold email is like, even us, you
know, we do this, like, this is what we do.
Most cold email replies are still negative, like unsubscribe, not interested. But do you know, idea
on like what percentage of the 1% overall would be like positive replies, like 10%, 5%, 20%?
Allan Ramsay
10% probably sounds right.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Okay. So I would say you're, we try to aim for a 3% overall reply rate. Yeah. On the try to
aim for like, between 10 and 20% of those responses to be positive.
Allan Ramsay
it.
Jack Bricknell
So I'd say probably the setup is probably partly an issue, because you should be up at a higher
overall reply rate, which is more about your deliverability than the copy you're writing.
Allan Ramsay
I agree with that. I think that a lot of people, when they're looking at my emails, they're like,
they're not perfect.
I'm like, I don't actually think that, and I could get in an argument about this with a lot of people, I
don't actually think it's the email you're writing.
Jack Bricknell
It's like, is the person in the buying cycle, right?
Allan Ramsay
And if you can hit home with something, I don't think it needs to be the perfect email. You just
need to, tell me if I'm wrong, but you just need to get in the inbox.
That's the game.
Jack Bricknell
And that's really why we use a tool that's specifically for cold emailing. We use like different, like,
we have four different cold email softwares that we routinely rotate through and track data on
which one gets to the inbox.
Because especially with an offering like Kanji's, like it's more so, it's a little bit closer to like
demand capture than it is to demand generation in that you're finding those people that have a
pain point probably right now with, you know, one of the legacy solutions, and then you're, you
know, you just need to take those people, rather than convincing someone who's already super
happy with job or whatever.
So yeah, I think definitely we want to send more emails. And we want to get you like, I would
say, you know, keep your Apollo thing running.
But if we did a setup, we would set it up inside one of our softwares where we're going to have a
much like 3x the reply rate.
And so even if we're still staying at that 10%, like if we took the exact copy you're using, didn't
implement any of our changes and just had that 10% positive reply rate, you'd have three times
more interested leads simply because the reply rate is three times higher.
Allan Ramsay
Do want give us a peek behind the kimono of what you're actually doing, or is it like black box?
Jack Bricknell
So we can add you into a workspace, into one of our software. So let's say we set up a reach
inbox for you, and then you can jump in.
Some clients, they just want us to book the meetings onto their calendar. Some clients, just CC
you in to all the interested responses, and then also do the appointment setting.
And then some, you know, you want to be super involved and be in the workspace.
Allan Ramsay
Everything kind of works, just depending on what you want. Yeah. I'm just trying to learn, you
know, twofold. One for this company, but just for my like edification, I think this is the way it's
secure.
And selfishly, I want to like learn how to do it. Yeah. I would be interested if it's not a black box,
like where you're showing us like, hey, here's the steps we're taking with cleaning in emails, the
things we're using.
And I'm also getting a lot of pushback on our side of like, well, we don't need extra domains.
Why is that the case?
Jack Bricknell
I'm like, you're all idiots. Yeah, so like, for example, if we do a 3,000 email setup, 3,000 emails,
we're sending 15, that's 200 inboxes we need, and it's three inboxes per domain.
So you're looking at 66 domains, which like, we just include that. Like, if you, you know, work
with us, we just buy all that infrastructure.
For you. But yeah, like I can, I can imagine trying to deal with like, you just want to buy a few
more $12 domains and having to deal with that is it's definitely frustrating.
Allan Ramsay
How much they cost? It's just, well, how much does it cost? Let me ask you this quick.
Jack Bricknell
How much does it cost to do the domain plus set it up on like Google? Um, well, we have some
really nifty ways of keeping our costs extremely low.
So like we use, instead of paying Google eight bucks per user, have let's Let's We have
resellers that we pay $2 per user per month, because you can imagine we have thousands and
thousands of email inboxes, so pay, you know, and then, like, also with domains, we can pay,
instead of paying $12 like most people do, we, you know, we use .code domains or .coms from,
like, Porkbun or there's a site called tld-list.com, which actually tells you all the different domain
registrars.
And which ones are running the cheapest pricing. So, yeah, that's, a good site resource. But,
yeah, I'm happy you're on with the right guy if you want to look at all the nerdy stuff.
I did, you know, I'm happy to, like, kind of dive deep into that and show you a bunch of stuff like
copy and then also the technical side of things.
Allan Ramsay
Cool. Walk me through your pricing, because I think that'll be the big sticking point for us.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Yeah, I get you. So, we do a three month trial. Yeah. It's $3,000 up front and $3,000 a
month to run.
Fairly straightforward.
Allan Ramsay
And how many emails do we get with something like that?
Jack Bricknell
$3,000 per day, and then there's 22 sending days in a month, typically. So that's around $66,000
a month. And then if you want more, it scales up.
Allan Ramsay
Yeah. And we would have to provide you those lists of people?
Jack Bricknell
No. So you give us an idea of who your ICP is. We include all the lead list scraping. We
subscribe to Apollo, ZoomInfo for financial stuff, PitchBook, all the databases, obviously
because we've got dozens of clients.
So it's included. What you can do is, as a supplemental thing, if you want to give us lists, we can
run campaigns with those lists.
But we have lead list scraping fully included in the service.
Allan Ramsay
Got it. How do you do it? How you make sure that you're not, like, contacting people that are,
like, owned by an AE, like, a target account for an AE, or, like, a current client?
Jack Bricknell
So, usually, with those scenarios, we'll get two lists from you. need a DNC list, so anyone that
has previously replied, like, don't contact us under your stuff, you give us that list.
We add them into a block list, so no one gets the email again. And then, also, if you have a list
of, like, current clients that you don't want us to contact, we just take that list and put it into that
same block list.
Allan Ramsay
Got it. Okay, cool. So, let me ask you this question while I have you here. So, what I'm looking
at is basically a $12,000 spend?
Jack Bricknell
Yes.
Allan Ramsay
Okay. Is this the site you're talking about, this one?
SCREEN SHARING
Allan started screen sharing
Yep. can use that to verify emails, super straightforward.
Allan Ramsay
I can just, like, use it, and then, do you think this is real?
Jack Bricknell
time. Bye. Bye. Bye. We use the one-time service, so you can try the automated email
verification, but what it is for us is we have like 10 million credits on there that we've bought
through a bank.
Yeah, I don't need 10 million credits on there.
Allan Ramsay
I think the most I have is like 20,000 contacts while we're doing this, so all of those contacts are
actually getting emailed, right?
It's only like the specific buyer persona. So I might do something like this and pay for it myself
and see what it does.
Yeah. Would you say you suggest that over something like Clay?
Jack Bricknell
Clay is great. Clay is, you know, you can do all sorts of AI personalization. We use it for some of
our own stuff, but honestly, a lot of people overdo it.
So like Well, I was talking more about like email verification because with Clay, you can like
waterfall it, right?
Allan Ramsay
Where you do like 15-
.
Jack Bricknell
We use MillionVerifier over Clay for email verification because it's cheaper volume-wise, way
cheaper.
Allan Ramsay
Got it, okay. Yeah, and especially if it's looking at something like, I'd have to look at it, but... I
have to sign up for an account to look at it, but anyways, all right, why MillionVerifier over
somebody else?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, MillionVerifier is very strict. That's just for the email verification side of things. Like, if
you're paying a million, if you get a million credits for $389, like, debounce, never bounce, any of
these, it's like $2,000.
So the difference is, and it's very good quality. We use it. It works great. I'm trying to think of
some other tools for you.
Anyway, yeah, you know, you could definitely start using that. That would help your bounce
rates, because if you have high bounce rates, you're going to burn.
Allan Ramsay
You do me a favor, will you send me a NOAA email? I think you were on the NOAA email, were
you not, or were you?
Jack Bricknell
If I'm not, I can get on there. It's not a big deal. I'll get that over.
Allan Ramsay
Could you kind of give a high-level overview of what your diagnosis of our situation is? I think
having someone else say it out loud, and he actually believes me, I think it's others, would help.
I'm trying to create a narrative of like, yo, y'all, I'm doing what I can. Everyone thinks it's the
copy, and I don't actually agree with that.
Jack Bricknell
Can I take a look at the copy?
Allan Ramsay
Yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Because I'm sure there's some optimizations, but I also would agree with you that if you're
getting a 10% positive reply rate, that's not bad at all.
Allan Ramsay
Let me take a look.
Jack Bricknell
look. right.
Allan Ramsay
Here's one that we use, right? I've been using this as a copy.
SCREEN SHARING
Allan started screen sharing
You are doing very well. The copy is not a problem. I go into so many corporate companies and
they're sending paragraph-long, two-paragraph-long emails.
You have it exactly right, which is to keep it really short. For this example, I don't like to use too
many bulleted lists because it looks like a sales email.
The other example you just showed me, we just helped this company save 600 hours a year on
device management.
Would you be interested in learning more? I would make some small changes to this, but failure
here is not because of the copy, in my opinion.
Allan Ramsay
Okay. Cool.
Jack Bricknell
That's good to know. So you can tell your colleagues that We send 10 million cold emails a
month, and the copy is, in my opinion, fine, yeah.
Allan Ramsay
And then I think in the email, so let's go back to pricing, let me pull it up again. Is there any
guarantees, or walk me through that?
Jack Bricknell
As far as guarantees, we don't have a specific number of demos we're going to get you every
month. Our goal usually with clients, something we're really good at is opening enterprise
accounts.
That's really our strength area. So we just try and get high quality meetings that end in revenue.
ultimately our goal is, I can tell you, about 80% of the time, companies move forward past the
three month trial.
about 20% drop off, 80% of time. So we do the trial and, you Work with companies where you're
selling something that's expensive enough for it to ROI, if we can get you 20 meetings with
interested prospects over the course of the three months, you can close out a few deals and it
ROIs from there.
That's basically our goal.
Allan Ramsay
What else would you want to chat about? This is helpful, by the way.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. I think what we would do probably is keep you running Apollo because you don't want to
shut off everything internally.
Just keep running that. I think there's definitely some optimizations we could make in terms of
immediately you need to start verifying the emails regardless of that.
Then also, we'll get you set up in one of the softwares we use, probably reachinbox.ai for
sending emails. There's also instantly.ai if you were
We do it internally. We use Reach Inbox because we've negotiated a bulk agreement to get a
bunch of accounts.
I think that there are small things with copy. One other thing is usually you cannot really get
away with sending links and emails, even in the signature.
So we don't send any links and emails. don't do any open tracking as well, besides the first
week. And the reason for that is open tracking puts a piece of code into the email that reduces
your deliverability and makes it more likely you land spam.
That's another thing you might want to... If you realize now your open rates are fine, I would
probably turn over...
I don't even know if Apollo lets you do that, but if it does, you should do that. And yeah, what
would you need from me?
I know you want a recap email. What kind of things can I get you that can help you, I guess,
move this forward?
ACTION ITEM
Send recap email to Noah and Allan detailing findings from call + why/how JB's company can
help Kanji
Uh... Yeah. My initial thought is that $12,000 is going be a hard justification for me. Yeah. You
need to send an email to Noah and I of like, here's what I found while talking with y'all, and
here's why I think we can do it and some kind of data behind it.
Yep. We go from there, right? Yeah, I think that the $12,000 would be a hard justification, just
being honest.
But it's also one of those things that if you can prove it, I agree, it's one of those like we're giving
you that money with no guarantee that it's going to work.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, I get you. I mean, it's not like we've never implemented guarantees. It's just that it's hard
to do a broad guarantee because we have an investment.
You know what I mean? So I could probably spin a guarantee for you. We have like a client
who's an investment bank who needs like three meetings a month for it to pay for, pay for itself a
hundred times over, right?
Yeah. Whereas with you guys, it's different. What would be a win for?
Allan Ramsay
I think it's the meeting set, right? We're confident that if you get us meetings, that we can close
them.
Jack Bricknell
That's never been our issue. It's fine.
Allan Ramsay
And so I think that's how I would also talk about it is, I think that as long as it's not, and well, and
I think the other guarantee would be like that you're going after Apple, like you found a way to
know that these companies have Apple devices, because what we wouldn't want to have
happen is you set 10 meetings with companies that are all Windows-specific?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. What we usually do for that is, I actually spoke with a company that does something
totally different, but they had the same thing where they just wanted to, a lot of software
companies have like a specific thing they want to, a platform they want to kind of like target.
What we would do for that is, we would put it in the copy that like, this is specifically for Apple
using companies, and then you just filter that out, because it's, then we don't have don't have
Limit as much on the on the data side. And yeah, I can put together a very robust based on like
our standard KPIs, you know, this percent reply rate, this percent positive reply rate, here's how
many demos we think we can land from each interest to reply.
ACTION ITEM
Create proposal w/ creative pricing (e.g. $5k upfront + $800/meeting), meeting guarantees
(8-10/mo for 500-1500 employee companies), math/data to support ROI
I can put that together. What, in terms of the number of meetings set, what is kind of a win for
12,000?
Is there like a pay per meeting mark? Is there, are certain meetings with larger companies worth
more than others?
Allan Ramsay
What are the meetings like there? The, the larger the account, the better off we are. The only
thing I can say is that we don't want to get into like the true enterprise, say like a LinkedIn, that's
not, we're not going to win those deals.
What I'm looking for is companies and like 500 to 1500 is where we're trying to get to as a
company, like on a consistent basis.
And so if you can book meetings in that. That would be huge. And with Apple devices. So if you
wanted to come up with some kind of pay per meeting model, I don't think we would be against
it.
And maybe you're saying, hey, this is going to cost you a little bit more. But like, get creative. I
think that our team is very open to creativity instead of like the normal list pricing of things.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Allan Ramsay
So yeah, those are just kind of a couple of my thoughts.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, we just did that for a company. We just did, I think it was 5k up front for the three months,
and then it was 800 per meeting.
And then it like, I think we could probably do something like that, if that would be more palatable
for you.
Allan Ramsay
I think so. So yeah, like, tell, like, come up with your best shot, like email Noah and I. And we,
I'm in, him and I are in meetings next week, face to face, so we can have the conversation.
You know, the nice thing here is that he was the one who passed this off to me. Yeah. I think
we're trying to learn how to do it, and so that's where it would be helpful.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, there's definitely a lot on that side that we could help with, too. Okay, I can get that to you.
Is there like a number of meetings per month that you think would be a good goal? Eight to ten.
I think eight to ten meetings per month in that 500 to 1500 employee range, potentially
expanding that a little bit more.
I think that's totally doable, and I can put together some math to show the numbers behind that.
Allan Ramsay
Yeah, and my guy, Noah, is a big math guy, so if you want to show that, I think that would be
helpful.
Jack Bricknell
Awesome. All right, I'll send that over, and then... Perfect. I have to jump onto my next one, but
is there...
When are you meeting with Noah?
ACTION ITEM
Schedule follow-up call w/ Allan for Wed after next @ 8:30am
Next week, but can you reach out? So like next week, we're in... And we're like in meetings all
week, so let's catch up on the week, like a week after that.
So if you want to just, this is usually a good time for me, 8.30, so if you want to just plop
something on there, like the Wednesday after or next at 8.30, that will work for me.
Jack Bricknell
Perfect. I will do that. Alrighty. Nice talking to you.
Allan Ramsay
Nice to meet you, man.
Jack Bricknell
Have a good day. You too.
Allan Ramsay
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
2: "This meeting is being recorded.
Jack Bricknell
Hey there. How are you?
Jake
Doing well, man. How are you doing?
Jack Bricknell
Good. Good. Alrighty. I've got William on the calendar.
Jake
Sorry. I run a crypto company too. So I guess I created an alias and my alias is Jake. My name's
Will.
Jack Bricknell
Okay, cool.
Jake
Alright, Will.
Jack Bricknell
I just wasn't sure what should I call him. Dude, I did the same thing. I got an email that's Jack
Davis instead of Jack Bricknell.
Jake
Yeah. You gotta know when to use it.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, exactly. You said you run a crypto company.
Jake
What other companies do you run? So the crypto company pays the bills and all that stuff. But
then I have a bunch of, well, for...
get? It's Yeah. Let's see. I have a kind of a health and wellness business that is familiar with
cold plunges, I assume.
Yeah. So like we go to people's homes and we build what's called a sweat deck where it's like a
sauna, cold plunge, outdoor shower, the deck, all that stuff.
It's not like D to C. It's like actually like the white space in between. Sorry, my dog's chewing
twinkles.
Sorry, stop. And so that's one of the companies that's that's I think where I wanted to focus this.
But then we have launching two different apps, one for property management and then one for
weddings.
Those should be launching the next two to three weeks. So I want to do this for that as well.
But like I'm I'm a growth marketer. I sold a marketing company in 2014. And a lot of like a lot of
my learnings besides paid traffic was outbounds, getting people, you know, SMS blasts like.
Scraping lists, know, doing all, like, in the trenches stuff that you do, and I used to own some
e-com companies, and I would set up flows in Klaviyo or ActiveCampaign and stuff like that, but
now that I'm coming full circle, I'm like, damn, I don't have any outbound strategy for my
Sweatdex company.
It's literally all through paid, so it's, like, warm paid leads that come in, that go through my
funnel, set up for a call, and they're, like, ready to go once they get on a call, but, like, dude, I'm
not doing any out of a process, especially with AI now, you know, there's a million ways to do
outbound, and so I was like, instead of me trying to kind of set up NAN and use all these
different tools, let me work with somebody that, you know, does And let's have an expert get in
there and chop it up, because I'm sure I could do it, but I just don't want to.
I don't want to spend all the time doing it by myself and then, you know what I mean?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, that makes total sense. I mean, you sold a marketing company, so obviously you
understand a little bit about marketing, but yeah, that makes total sense.
What's sort of the target audience for Sweat Decks?
Jake
So Sweat Decks is like, you could start with the required audience, which is like you have to be
a homeowner, so that's one thing.
The ticket size is between $20K and $60K, basically, for these builds, so you've got to have
some money. But you could do people that own Airbnbs, you could do gym owners, kind of like
anybody who's an executive at a company.
I have a brief, because I was on Upwork, like, hey, trying to get the data. Because back in the
day when I was getting data, I would go to, like, Data Depot or Info USA.
you the mics well watching, great dude love I've o энd We cheap as . And so, um, now it's not,
now I like went to like experience.
was like, this isn't, this isn't the same way. So I was trying to figure out how to get the leads list
and then clean it.
Um, but yeah, basically any business owners in health and wellness is like where my target
was. I will say like Airbnb owners or, um, those are prime.
Like they, this is like such a value add for them. Like that's all about it. So yeah, those are kind
of the targets, but like Jim owners like, uh, CrossFit people.
Yeah. People that have a house and, and, and, and we're only in certain cities right now. So like
Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas, uh, Los Angeles, all parts of Los Angeles.
Um, and then New England, Massachusetts area. Uh, and then Utah. I have, I have all the zip
codes and stuff.
Jack Bricknell
Okay. All right. Um, gotcha. All right. So the one thing that I have in the, So D2C cold email is
very difficult because if you try to send the personal emails, so like at gmail.com or one of them,
you'll burn your infrastructure super quick.
So the approach is, I like how you mentioned.
Jake
I'm ordering up emails right now as well.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, you want to be careful with that. So you only want to send to B2B, so
like at company.com emails.
But you can still do that by just grabbing executives at health and wellness companies within
those areas. And maybe, you know, honestly, with this, I'd probably just go for a higher volume
campaign where you hit general executives as well.
And then also anyone who's in a senior position at any kind of company with like the keyword
short term rental or any of that kind of stuff to get those Airbnb people.
Because I have seen this a lot, like. When I see these Airbnb guru guys, they always have some
kind of thing like, I'm looking at your website, thing like this, like on the property, and you can
charge a lot more because you have it.
Jake
Yeah, exactly. So not even charge a lot more. What's happened in the Airbnb world is like, just
having a house to rent is not doing, it doesn't matter.
It's like the amenities now is like the whole thing.
Jack Bricknell
Yep. Yep. Okay. Got you. All right. Massachusetts, New England. Cool. And you said you're,
you're warming up emails now.
Jake
Yeah. So I'm using, I had a guy that I'm working with. He's trying, he's going to set the flows and
like NAN and stuff, but whether, whether I like, whether we do it or not, you know, it's, it's, I still
want to, I still want to talk to someone like yourself because he was more of like a flows guy.
And I'm like, yeah, let's, I'm using smart lead.ai to warm up leads.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Jake
Yeah. Thank Yep. Yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Okay. Cool. Do you know how many inboxes you have?
Jake
I think I've got five or six. One extra for each of my sales guys. Okay. But I can warm up to 50.
Jack Bricknell
I don't care. Yeah, yeah. The thing is with five or six inboxes, what are the domains on them?
Jake
Is it like at sweatdex.com? Yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Okay. All right. You're going to want to be super, super careful with this. So here's the
approach. I'll tell you what we do.
Yeah. I'm going to save your right now. So if I have a company, like a client, let's say, we have
one, Katie and Talent.
I was just doing their setup yesterday. We don't send emails from katientalent.com because
what will happen is if you do that, you'll burn your domain reputation of your main domain, which
means.
You're Thank Anytime you start sending from sweatdex.com, you're going to have issues
because domains always burn. It's just a matter of how long it takes until they burn.
We can do a lot of things to make it take longer, but it will always happen. That's why we never
use your main domain because then you're going to be going to spam on your main domain.
Companies come to me and they're like, even our internal emails are going to spam. It's a huge
problem. So what you do instead is you go buy, go sweatdex.com or sweatdexco.com.
You buy like, imagine you get like 50 of those and they're lookalike domains is what you call
them. And that basically means that they can redirect to sweatdex.com when people type it in.
But if they burn, it doesn't matter. You just buy new domains and it's not going to cause a big
issue for you.
Second reason that's important is because you have five, six inboxes, a safe amount to see.
And per inbox per day is like 15.
So if you have five inboxes, you can send like 75 emails a day, which is like nothing. You want
to send like this, for instance, the smallest setup I do for clients is 2000 emails a day.
That's the smallest. And the way that looks is if we get you 50 domains, you can put three
inboxes safely per domain.
It's like the rule with the look like domain setup. You can have 150 inboxes, which means you
can send 15 per inbox per day.
150 times 15 is 2000 to 50. And that's a pretty, pretty standard setup. So like, yeah, don't send
with those sweat decks.com things.
Like it's not going to immediately screw you. You'll be fine for like a couple months probably. And
even you might, it might even not be a huge problem because.
We're only sending 75 emails a day. If your whole organization is sending more than that, then
it's not – like if that would only make up like 10% of your whole organization sending.
Like if your organization was sending 750 emails a day and you're only sending 75 that are
marketing, it wouldn't be a problem.
But I would doubt that you're sending that many. So just save yourself the potential headache
and don't send from those.
I promise you it's not worth.
Jake
And you're going to want do the low. Can you set up SMTP directly from Smartlead so I don't
have to set up like Google ?
Jack Bricknell
I have a guy in like Pakistan that does all the DNS, all the setup, all that crap. I don't even look
at it.
Like I used – I remember I used to do that like manually. It was the biggest pain in the ever.
But now I have a guy and like it's like excellent – I don't know, a few bucks a domain and I just
have him do everything.
Jake
So yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So that's good. You won't burn your mind away now. Perfect.
Smartlead is good as well.
The other ones are Instantly. Instantly is performing slightly better than Smartlead, but honestly,
if you're already on Smartlead, there's no point in switching.
What else are you doing? Talk to me a bit more about, like, that's your setup.
Jake
Yeah, that's basically it. Like, I have the setup for where I would warm up and where I would
send.
I have leads lists that I got. I haven't looked at them. I don't know if they're good. Basically,
everything I would do, I would basically upload it to, like, Never Bounce or something to, like,
confirm the emails are legit or not.
But I don't really have a lead list I trust at all. So, I mean, I would be open if you're, if you have
the keys to the castle, I'll be working with you on that.
And then, like, I haven't even set up the flows. Or the other one. I don't know. I'm very open to
that, too.
I'm pretty much looking to be like, hey, pull someone in with the experience, hand it off. And by
the way, this is company number one.
Company number two, and three, I think so much easier. So when we get to the property
management and wedding app, great.
We buy a list of wedding planners or a registry of brides.
Jack Bricknell
Yep.
Jake
Property managers, pretty straightforward. Buy a list of property managers. Boom. And so much
easier in terms of prospecting. yeah, I would want to use someone like yourself to do all of it.
Just literally hand it off, set it up, turn it on.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Never Bounce, by the way, you should try Millian Verifier. Never Bounce is
one I like the big play.
And they sell to corporate companies and they're like 10 times the price, but it's the same email
verification cost.
So it's nothing. So like use, use a million verifier in the future for that. But, um, yeah. Where'd
you source the least lead lists from?
Jake
you know, uh, I just some random dude off of, uh, Upwork. Basically you sent me, you just sent
me gigabytes worth.
Cause I was like, go yourself because he was like trying to like charge me 2k.
Jack Bricknell
was like, no, I'm not doing stuff.
Jake
Your leads are good. So they just uploaded on each thing. I downloaded it all. I haven't even, I
mean, I opened them and saw there's a ton of leads, but yeah, I'm like, put another post out for
like a Python developer to come and merge them all into one.
But I, at the end of the day, am I even going to use these or should I just talk to somebody like
you?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'll take a look at them just to, just to see. mean, you know, might as well,
but, um, yeah, we scraped leads from, like,
Like Apollo, LinkedIn, all that kind of stuff, and you know, as you can imagine.
Jake
He sent me 13 gigs, or sorry, 13, 14, 16 gigs of Apollo leads. So I've got 500 million leads from
Apollo.
Jack Bricknell
Nice. Yeah, that's interesting because they only have 300 at a time usually. That's super
interesting. We'll take a look at it.
He just gave you the whole Apollo database. My only concern is that might be that we have this
one leak that's like a couple years old, and if you put it into a verifier, tells you it's like 80%
invalid, but hopefully it's not.
mean, that might be useful data. I could compare it with the Apollo DB that we downloaded.
Anyway, cool. I don't think the leads will be a problem.
In the worst case, we can just scrape new stuff. Interesting. All right. And, um, you're good. I'm
leads right now from ads and that's like working well, what's, you want to do outbound?
What's like kind of a goal for outbound in terms of, you want to basically meetings with people
who would be interested in having this set up in their thing and then you can pitch them and
eventually you can do it for the app.
But what are you, what, like how many meetings are you getting every month from ads and then
what would be a goal for, for outbound?
Jake
Yeah, I mean, we get, we'll see, I don't, I got to look at my daily spend. think we're spending like
200, 250 a day on ads.
We get two to four meetings per day. I don't know our total lead count. think lead count is around
like eight or 10 leads per day.
And then we convert like 20% of that into meetings. And it's a flow, right? Like, so it's like they,
they put in the opt-in form and then after they click submit, the opt-in form goes to a calendar
link, right?
Okay. Well, Yeah. You. And, yeah, and, I mean, a lot, like, we have so much creative. I mean,
you look at this stuff, you kind of know right away, like, if you're going to get this, you know.
It's pretty badass. And so I don't know what the success should look like from an outbound cold
campaign. I feel like we're going to find a certain user type who's like, I've been looking for this.
And I think that might be in the real estate sector or the gym owner kind of, or the gym owner
kind of, like, persona.
So, yeah, so my goals, I don't know, like, even if we did it, and if it was going off, and we were
getting an extra two jobs a month from this, I'd be like, win to me.
Jack Bricknell
Like, what is it to get two jobs, like, out of, how many meetings is two jobs?
Jake
So that's a good question. I, traditionally, with most of my companies, Good news I would know.
I think I'd have to go look at the data.
I don't spend a lot of time in this business, just because like, I come in, I help with the marketing
and then like I let kind of my CEO run it.
But if we're doing what, 10 leads a day to convert, maybe out of 20 leads, convert one. Quick
math, I think we do like, maybe eight projects a month.
Jack Bricknell
All right, let me, so if you're getting like, let's say you're getting two meetings per day, 60
meetings a month, let's call it, then that leads to eight projects.
So it's like, whatever the math is on that, would that, so it'd be about like 13% of meetings.
Jake
And that's pretty good, actually, and in a job for something like this, I think. Yeah, it's pretty good
because it's inbound, right?
So like when they see the ad, and they come to the landing page, I used Build funnels and do
copywriting and all that stuff.
So they see the ad and they come to the landing page. mean, there's no convincing. There's no
selling. either know this is going be expensive.
You've been wanting this. So it's really like a salesperson just comes to you, talks to you through
what it is, all the different costs.
But you don't have to get sold on it. And, by the way, I just sent you all the lead lists that this
dude sent.
Jack Bricknell
Oh, okay.
Jake
Cool. I don't know.
Jack Bricknell
I hope they still work. yeah. I see. So I'll just paste this. What'd you pay this guy for these?
Jake
I haven't even paid him yet. Oh, nice. paid 500 bucks. I paid like a thousand and I was like, go .
Cause I already did the job. I had put up five, bucks and he was like a thousand. like, go
yourself.
So I did a refund and then he just sent me all the links. Like, yeah, please fix my.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. These guys are desperate on Upwork and Fiverr to not get banned and bad reviews and
what.
Jake
It's also like, he's like, he's got data that's not, you know, doesn't cost anything to take 500
bucks or not.
Jack Bricknell
Like, yeah. Um, okay. Here's what I'll say. I'll give you my honest, super honest opinion is, um,
when it comes to stuff like, like 13% of meetings ending in a job that you're right, that's like
higher than it's usually going to be because this is people who like, they see the ad, they know
exactly what it is.
Whereas with an email, we do something that's like two or three sentences. And it's like, like, we
can't even put images in the email.
This is like where it's like the whole cell of the image. Like, so honestly, I don't, the value add, I
think with this business, with, with email, um, is I think the potential to work with like, Oh, go out
to a guy who owns 20 short form.
Um, short term rentals. Um. Um. Do one, like, get him interested, do one job for him, and then
have plenty jobs come from that.
That's where I think email would be a value add, because you're not going to reach that guy as
much with an ad as you can directly emailing a guy who, you know, runs a short, you know,
owns 20 properties or like this, that kind of thing.
So, like, that's, I think, the value add with email, because I'll be very honest with you. Like, even
getting 20 meetings a month is not easy with email, and it would not be easy targeting certain
geographic areas and certain executives in that geographic area, and then persuading them,
like, it is kind of a demand capture thing.
Like, if you're already thinking about getting a, one of these things in your backyard, then that's
where this would come in.
Like, just as an email guy, being very realistic, I don't think the... when you're they're sure they're
So there's a huge value add in like trying to sell this by cold email unless you're also – like we
could try it out, but I really couldn't guarantee you any results because I have no idea whether it
will work or not.
The value add, I think, would be going to the B2B guys, like really B2B, like a guy who owns a
short-term rental company because you score even one of those.
That relationship will make you – if you're – what was it like, I don't know, $20,000 a job or
$50,000 a job, like you get 10 jobs from that that pays for this many times.
Jake
Dude, I'm game. I'd rather go after – I'd rather not go after like the homeowners. I'd rather go
after – like that's the thing.
Like our best projects are with people that are like, hey, I'm building a retreat. Like they have a
retreat site or something like that or like the
They're short-term rental people or like we've even done some like small hotels. You know what
I mean? So like those, yeah, like even gyms, we've had some gyms reach out to us.
Jack Bricknell
Gyms. Okay. So I'm just thinking it out live. It's like, honestly, like if you were just going to do this
for homeowners, I would just tell you like, yeah, I could probably persuade you and take your
money, but I don't think it would work.
So I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to do it. But for this, for B2B, I can see it working, especially if we
took a local approach.
Hey, um, we're building, uh, you know, cold plunges or however we want to describe it, um, in
this area, um, you know, thought, you know, might, this might be helpful or useful for you.
Would you just like to see how one looks? Then you get the interest there. And, and then you're
able to, once someone replies.
You can send all the links you want. You can send whatever you want. So then you go and you
say, you know, here's our website.
Here's an example project we did in Houston, in Los Angeles, whatever, or for a gym. You know,
you may be interested in, you know, 15-minute conversation to see if this would be a fit for you.
That, I think, could work.
Jake
Yeah, I like that. Like, hey, hey, did you see the projects? We finished over in Name This
Neighborhood That Everybody Knows.
Like, wait, who is this?
Jack Bricknell
What project?
Jake
Boom. Like, now the response, you're like, oh, this one.
Jack Bricknell
Like, then there's a picture.
Jake
Oh, this looks so cool.
Jack Bricknell
Who are you guys? Yeah. Local approach works really well because then you don't come off as
just a spammy emailer guy.
You come off as like, oh, you know, this is a local contractor in the area, whatever.
Jake
And what we could do is... We could plug the pixel. We could set up landers for the flow. I did
this a long time ago.
So let's say this project here, they go, oh, the project here, they click on the link, they go, it's like
this beautiful, blah, blah, blah.
I can set up a pixel on that page and just hammer them with retargeting for all that.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, because you know those are high value prospects. Okay, I like it. think it's also like with
the same infrastructure set up, like I said, like 2,000 emails a day or even maybe we do
something smaller here, we could try out the direct to executives in those areas and just let's try
because it wouldn't cost anything.
Once you set up the email infrastructure, it doesn't cost extra to send up to your capacity, if that
makes sense.
So like it might as well be like, all right, bucket, let's try that. I just don't have this huge optimism
about that element being really fruitful, but there's no harm in trying that.
So I think that could work. I'd probably set up a new instantly. Probably our team would write all
the flows.
I could have it. So there's like two potential options. The first is like my team kind of manages
everything, basically leads, writing the flows, inbox management when the leads come in and
then booking the appointments for you.
The second option would be more of a consulting kind of gig. And so that would be we bill you
once to set everything up for you and then you just keep.
Me on retainer to make sure things are running well, you would do the inbox management and
we would get on, you know, twice a month to make new campaigns and talk about, you know,
how are the other ones performing from that end?
It's, it's like less work from my end. And obviously, so that's a kind of cheaper option, but it
sounds like, I don't know, which, which would probably be more appealing for you initially.
Jake
So like, I know myself pretty well and I'm pulled a thousand directions. So like initially I'd rather
have like done for you, like you, you're, you go and see how it goes in their future.
Is there an opportunity for me to bring it in house on it? Maybe, but like, I'm at the state where I
would just like bring in the expert place, you know, cause I, dude, I had, I had, you I have my
own just sidebar.
I had my own like paid traffic team I've been working with for a long time. They're okay. But it
was like, just get the job done.
And I wrote the initial funnels, a lot of stuff. I've had the same funnels since the beginning of the
business for like 18 months.
And I brought a guy on six months ago building all these crazy things. And then I got pulled into
something and I never finished it with him.
And I was like, all right, like if I could just give somebody the full baton to go do what they've got,
I'm going to drop off and it's not going to get done.
So, yeah.
Jack Bricknell
No, I mean, that's a very – like you clearly know yourself. Well, that's like – yeah, I can see why
you've been successful in these different business ventures.
You know what you're good at. It's who, not how.
Jake
When I mentor him, he's like, dude, you don't need to know how to do it. Just find the right
person to do it and just get out of the way.
Jack Bricknell
like, all right. That's – Okay.
Jake
Enough of it's dangerous, but yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Cool. All right. But of what I've described so far, does it sound like this is something you want to
do?
Jake
Yeah, for sure. You know, I want to give it a shot and see how it goes.
Jack Bricknell
is it –
Jake
If it makes sense, and it makes sense financially and all the above, like, then I know that I have
somebody that I can use for the other things.
So, like, the other thing, I have a TikTok approach for this business and the other stuff, too. So
I've got, like, 20 TikToks now, but I'll have 100 soon, which, like, I have a whole team in content,
then different phones, on different IP addresses.
Yeah, wow, you're a real marketer, man. I love it. That's awesome. Well, dude, I watched these
little kids right out of college make, like, 50K MRR with their stupid app, and they have TikTok
farms.
And I was like, oh, I can do that. So I started trying to talk around TikTok farms, found a guy who
has, like, 65 accounts, and it was way more intricate than I could imagine.
Like, you can't have everything on one phone. You can't have everything on one computer with
virtual phones. It has to be really nice.
So, um, but , if you get it, what all of sudden a hundred million views.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Jake
Yeah.
Jack Bricknell
I've seen those contractors. You do the before and after those kinds of videos are always really
high performing. Um, but yeah, that's cool.
All right. Well, let me get to the pricing. Uh, and then you can make a decision on, on what
makes sense.
So for the done for you, it would be three K set everything up. Um, and then three K a month to
run it.
We typically do a three month trial. So you're not locked in for a very long period of time. Um,
and that's typically how we would set it up.
That covers pretty much everything being handled for you.
Jake
Uh, if you could lower the setup fee, I'm down for three K a month consecutively.
Jack Bricknell
Okay. Um, I'm just trying to think about if we did, just give me one sec. Um, we did two jobs and
email.
I could probably do 2,200 for setup, and the reason that's such a random number is because
that is kind of like coming down on what the actual hard cost would be, but if that works for We
can get it done.
ACTION ITEM
Initiate 2-week email warm-up process for SweatDex campaign
How quickly would you guys be able to set? I mean, I know you have to warm up.
ACTION ITEM
Task team to start lead list polling & campaign messaging for SweatDex
Yeah, the warm up is two weeks, but what we do is I'll get that warm up done in a business day
so that we can get the clock started.
And then while that two weeks is happening, we're doing all the lead list polling, all the
campaign messaging, so that right after that two weeks, it's good to go.
So it's about 15 days all in.
Jake
Cool. Expanding Expanding. in Territories, obviously that's not going to happen anytime soon,
but I imagine that's not going to – I mean, it kind of shouldn't increase the price because it's just
a new territory.
Jack Bricknell
It's Same cost to do it. What you're buying essentially is the system and the people. We can do
new campaigns, all that stuff, no additional cost.
Jake
Yeah, it would just be grabbing new leads, but that's – I assume you have guys.
ACTION ITEM
Send proposal via PandaDoc to Jake
Yeah, we cover the cost of that. You don't have to pay for leads. Yeah.
ACTION ITEM
Send Stripe payment links to Jake for setup fee and monthly fee
All right. We'll do it.
Jack Bricknell
Awesome. All right. Let me send you a proposal really quick. That'll take me, I don't know, a
couple hours, and then I'll just send you – is it cool with you if we – if I collect a little deposit from
you here?
ACTION ITEM
Pay $500 deposit via provided Stripe link
Yeah. How much are thinking? Like 500 bucks. Yeah, that's fine.
Jake
I know the game.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Yeah. I figured you got to lock them in. Yeah, you got to make sure they're committed. you
don't, you know, have the back and forth.
Exactly. Exactly. Alrighty. Cool. Alrighty. I'm just going to send you this link in the, in the zoom
chat. Great.
Cool. Awesome. And then let me just get, make sure I get this in my notes as any of that
proposal.
I'll send that over by email later today. Okay. Thank Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank you. Is
it working for you?
Jake
Yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Jake
Okay.
Jack Bricknell
Perfect.
Jake
There you go. Good to go.
Jack Bricknell
Good to go? Yep. Awesome. Okay. Cool. I'm going to email you over to the proposal. I'll just
send it by PandaDoc.
And… Um. I And then I'll send you the Stripe links. And if you have any questions, concerns,
anything like that, let me know.
Once everything's paid, we'll set up a follow up. We can even set up a follow up now. What's
your what's your availability like?
Let's say Monday. What's it like this week?
Jake
I'm pretty open. mean, I just have meetings around 10. What are you?
Jack Bricknell
What area are you in? Eastern.
Jake
Eastern time. I'm one hour behind. Okay. At 10.30 my times, I have calls. But other than that, I

3: "This meeting is being recorded. Hey, Chris.
Chris Wicker
Hi there, how are you?
Jack Bricknell
Well, how are you?
Chris Wicker
Winding down on a Friday.
Jack Bricknell
We both. Chris, I think, did you connect with us through an email?
Chris Wicker
Yes, I got an email from you. It's been something recently on the top of my list. And so I took a
look at your site and thought it would at be worth a conversation.
See if it matches, at least for further conversation, matches what I'm looking for.
Jack Bricknell
For sure. What are you looking for?
Chris Wicker
I need to supplement my outbound strategy. I recently went down a rep, plus the team's
struggling a little bit.
When I came to the organization in August, and then we took an investment a year ago this
month, this company had never done any outbound before.
So I had to build basically up the tools and everything from scratch, and it's proven to take a
little bit longer than what we anticipated from an outbound perspective.
And so I'm looking for just a bit of additional driving of qualified leads from an outbound cold
perspective for the team.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. Okay. What are you currently doing right now? What do you have set up?
Chris Wicker
We have ZoomInfo, we have LinkedIn Sales Navigator, we have our own database, and then
obviously off of that, we have HubSpot with website intents and those types of things, and the
team follows those and will act accordingly, but it's, as you know, outbound is really, really hard.
And so if we can supplement at a grander scale, while we continue to do our portion of a total
pipeline build.
time, called C. C. C. You Outside of inbound marketing, I wanted to look at it.
Jack Bricknell
Gotcha. Okay, great. Tell me a bit about your ICP, who are trying to reach with these outbound?
Chris Wicker
So we have a very unique value proposition in our space. We have the ability to deploy our
solution in multiple ways and multiple secure ways, one of those being self-hosted or hosted in
a private cloud, so your typical on-premise hosted environment.
the same exact product. There's one other company that does that. Everybody else is either
totally in the cloud or has gone to the cloud or pushing people to the cloud.
But there are certain organizations, healthcare, fintech, insurance, banking, even a government
at some level, even though I don't want a partner like this to go after a government business
force, they don't want their data leaving.
They may have it in the cloud. I would host it in a private cloud scenario in AWS or Azure or
whatever the case may be.
So they don't necessarily host it on their own servers, but they want that data protected and not
to go out to a public cloud.
And then we obviously have a traditional, same solution in our cloud on AWS in the relevant
territory. I'm only looking for the U.S., by the way, at least initially.
So our unique ICP is typically IT or HR, sometimes facilities. HR has been a very interesting one
for us because they're typically, they don't think of a help desk ticketing system as being
something that would solve their communication pathways to their employees.
So typically they're using, still using a shared inbox, going through email. There's no
assignment, there's no, they have to stay on top of those shared emails.
There's no reassignment based upon people being out. They just have to monitor it. So that's
been a very interesting
Interesting use case for us. And then obviously on the IT side, that can either be an external or
internal use case.
internally, IT support where, you know, I need a new password, my computer's not working,
printer on level floor four is not working, whatever the case may be from an internal IT
perspective.
And then external, which is less of our clients today, but is a customer support engagement. So
you have a support organization within a company supporting their external customers, and they
want to be able to have tickets and communicate with those customers via a ticketing system,
whether it be hosted or online through the cloud.
So it's really those three use cases from an individual ICT standpoint. It's anybody who
obviously has budget, but also has people reporting to them that are engaging with either
internal employees or external customers, and then depending on the department.
zam 1972. And the You know, what, what, what they're communicating to them about. Got it.
Typically that's the director level or higher.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. So director level or higher, um, HR, IT, and they have different use cases,
uh, depending on, okay.
Gotcha. What, what sorts of companies, I mean, is it mostly, I see a lot of, uh, enterprise sort of
case studies on your site.
Is that, uh, the typical target?
Chris Wicker
I'll be very transparent with you. That's a bit of a marketing spin. Yeah. For example, Apple is
one of our customers, but it's a team of 15 people sitting in Austin, Texas.
It's not all of Apple, right? Um, a lot of our larger, we, we, our largest customer today is about
500,000 a year in ARR.
Our average sale price, um, is, is about 10, 10 and a half thousand ARR. Um, and then we
obviously get the transactional business where we're more down in the 3,600, 3,000 range.
Um. It just depends. I'm really looking more to go up market with something like this. My
marketing team drives plenty of the smaller stuff because it's just, that's the way they buy.
So, you know, see a paid search ad or they'll read a piece of content or they'll just go to
organically search and see different options, whatever the case may be.
So I'm really looking for, you know, opportunities that would probably be 20 to $20,000 to
$25,000 or bigger ARR.
Jack Bricknell
Yep. What do those look like for you in terms of the types of companies? mean, we do a lot.
Our biggest, I think, in my opinion, our biggest strength with cold email is that you can reach
those kinds of people that, you know, they're not really scrolling around on social media.
You don't typically get enterprise accounts through like a paid ad as much as you can directly
targeting them with an email.
Chris Wicker
But tell me. Is your solution purely email?
Jack Bricknell
There's no. Okay. So, so we do. You know, there's virtue to doing omni-channel, you know,
email, LinkedIn, but the thing with email is as it's gotten a lot more difficult over time with
Outlook and Google becoming stricter on spam policies and all this kind of stuff, we try to be,
you know, rather than being a jack of all trades and a master of none, we focus on email and
specifically targeting more enterprise clients through email.
So, for instance, one of our recent clients, company called Predictive Safety, and they do safety
solutions, they only want companies that are very large and they want heads of HR, heads of
people responsible for safety, and we just got them into Ryanair, Avianca Airlines, and I'm
forgetting now, but another big one.
So we got them five of the 10 biggest airlines just booked on meetings with. Thank Either the
chief of human resources or the head of corporate safety.
So they are ICP. But that's what we're really good at, essentially, with email. So I'm trying to
think about when you say you'd like accounts that are 20,000 a year for you, for example, what
do those look like usually?
Chris Wicker
So like on an HR use case, you could have a 10,000 employee company that's supported by 25
HR people.
So that would really be a 25 user, 25, HR, we call them users, we'll call them agents.
Jack Bricknell
So 25 user license deal.
Chris Wicker
So that would roughly, you know, if was 25 on our professional package, so 25 times 59 times
12, that's a $17,000 deal.
Jack Bricknell
Got it.
Chris Wicker
Plus any professional services that we may, we may, we, we, we may tack on to that depending
on onboarding needs, support, those types of things.
Not support. Not from a support day-to-day, but just onboarding, getting them up to speed.
Yeah. If that same 25 went with our enterprise version, for example, that would be a $30,000
deal.
Give us $59.99 per license, right? But if you look at a non-HR use case, you could have a
support organization that's 500 employees, but for whatever their use case is, they might need
100 licenses.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Chris Wicker
Because they need other people, not just the agents in IT answering those questions. They may
need other people to weigh in on those tickets, actually solve the ticket, forward them, escalate
them, those type of things.
So it's really, there's not one set answer based upon the way our product works. Of course, the
market gotcha and we're not we're not unique in this space having to deal with that any desk it's
just you don't a 25 team member team in HR supporting call it 10,000 employees those 10,000
employees don't need access to their tickets yeah submit a form they would email whatever the
case may be in whatever channel the company wants to receive the ticket it comes in gets
allocated or assigned to the proper people and taken care of in some cases if it if it uses our AI
functionality it could potentially solve it without even out having an agent involved and then they
get their answer they self-serve and they move on gotcha okay so for for our purposes yes the
employee size does not necessarily indicate the amount of licenses because you were
mentioning okay got it that's helpful but in in instances where uh let's
Jack Bricknell
When you say like a 500-employee support organization, are you talking about a company that
does outsource customer support?
Chris Wicker
No, they may have a catalog of products that they're selling or supporting, and then customers
are emailing and saying, I didn't get the right product.
I got two of them versus three of them. I need a refund. This thing's broken. It needs to be
warrantied, whatever the case may be.
That's an external support use case. Internal support is, hey, I email IT at XYZ company. I need
my password reset.
My computer's not working. I need to schedule to get a loaner and get it fixed. Printer's not
working. I can't get logged in, what the case may be.
Jack Bricknell
Okay, so you got external and internal support use case. Okay. All right. Interesting.
Chris Wicker
I mean, it's typically, typically, you know, in my My opinion, where you're going to find those
revenues on an ARR level that would be of interest in investing dollars to support this, you're
probably going to be in the 150 to 350 employee count and anywhere from probably 75 to a
hundred million dollars.
Now, granted, you're going to have edge cases, right? I mean, you very well could have a $500
million company that only needs four seats in HR.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Chris Wicker
We'll take that, but that's not as exciting.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, I get you. Okay. And industry wise, you were mentioning fintech healthcare. The selling
point is that you're one of two that are actually, you know, secure.
Basically, where it's hosted is not necessarily a public cloud.
Chris Wicker
Correct. We have flexible deployment options. You can get the same product either in the cloud
or in a self-hosted environment.
That can be on your own server. informative 둘! Gulach It can be in a private cloud in AWS,
Azure, anywhere where you want to host it in a private cloud.
You go to someone like Zendesk, Freshdesk, they don't have that. They are a pure cloud
solution, and they make you host their product in their servers.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. So that's kind of a selling point. Is this a market where a lot of these companies are
already using a Zendesk or a helpdesk, or a market where a lot of them aren't using anything in
particular, emails, that kind of stuff?
Chris Wicker
So HR, it's probably, you might find 25%, 35% are using something, and they're probably using
something because they partnered with IT, and they're using what IT uses for their support.
But the majority of HR departments at the lower end don't have something today. They are
using a shared inbox, and they need to be educated on, hey, there's a better way to
communicate with your employees and make your HR users more.
Or productive by having the system allow the employee to self-serve the information they need
or self-serve the answers so they're set up there.
On the IT side of things, they're going to have something. They're going to have a Zendesk, a
Spiceworks, a Fresh Desk.
They're going to have something, and it very well even could be a homegrown system. But they
will have something that they're using to route tickets, respond to tickets, solve tickets, et cetera.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. But the sell there is kind of the main selling point I'm understanding is that private cloud
versus what are some of the other ones?
Chris Wicker
I think one thing we hear about Zendesk and Fresh Desk, for example, those are the two
elements in the room.
Their service is not the best. mean, Fresh Desk is, their service is all out of India. They're very,
Zendesk thinks they, they're like the king of the castle.
So we get a A of feedback if people are just tired of dealing with their support, if they've been
with them for a few years, they might have gotten several price rises and are looking to, or
maybe what they bought is overkill, maybe there's a change in ownership of that product
internally, and they're just reviewing options.
mean, in the world we live in today, I think most smart business leaders are always looking for
ways to be more efficient and to save costs.
But you talk to an IT director, he has a need, he already is using something, but there may be
frustration amongst his team saying, this piece sucks, we can't get this to work, they're not
solving my issues.
We're always having to talk to support, they're not very reliable, and it's more of a headache for
them at the admin level or the director level.
You're not going to find an IT leader who doesn't have somebody running the help desk
platform.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. Okay, good.
Chris Wicker
Let me just go. So I'm only bringing up the self-hosted piece is because it's a very unique value
proposition.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Chris Wicker
We don't care. The price is the same. Right. We don't care where you deploy it. It's just we have
that as an option, and we don't – prior to me getting here, I don't think we did a very – and still
we're working on improving it.
We didn't do a very good job of selling that. Yeah. Just say, what are you using today? Where
do you want it deployed?
And if they said on-premise, which we are now calling – we're trying to call it self-hosted
because it's not just on-premise.
On-premise is the old vernacular of you have a server room and it's stored on your own servers.
Well, self-hosted is you choose where you want to host it privately.
And so I just believe that there's an opportunity out there in certain verticals. Now, you might find
a defense contractor or a healthcare organization that's supporting the healthcare world.
on theourt. We'll That doesn't care. Yeah. Who knows, right? And so it's not a, hey, this industry
only uses this.
It's a certain app to want a self-hosted solution.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. Okay. So, yeah, we could test out and see what the market thinks of that point. Okay.
Cool.
Let me tell you about the approach we like to take with software companies. Um, and you let me
know how you think it could work or where you think how you would approach it.
Um, so like an example, predictive safety, I mentioned earlier, um, the way we brought on those
big airlines was fairly straightforward.
So we keep the emails two or three sentences, max, uh, sort of like the one I would assume you
received.
Um, the reason we do that is, is particularly in the large companies. And as more and more
people start doing email outreach and it's more accessible, um, Um, Um,
People don't really give the time of day to email messages, so you want to get straight to the
point.
In the example of the airline campaign we did for that software company, we said, you know,
hey, first name, Delta Airlines recently mandated our solution for their subcontractors.
On average, it reduces incident rate by 37%. Would you be interested in seeing a quick demo of
how it works?
That was the whole email. We take that. Send it out to anyone senior, responsible for safety,
HR, at other airlines, and, you know, when you name Delta Airlines, which is the largest airline
by revenue, and say, hey, they mandated this, and this is the average sort of result or unique
value that's provided, and you just say, you know, would you be interested in a demo?
It might not be them always that takes a demo, but the response rate was very, very high, and
we booked a ton of demos for them.
very much. Thank So I'm thinking about how we could leverage some of the names that you
have, and I get that it's kind of a marketing ploy.
totally get that. But it's a marketing ploy for a reason. That kind of messaging does work. So I'm
thinking about how some of the maybe statistics that we could potentially leverage, or especially
some of the brands that we could name.
And we like to do that. So we'll pick apart for them, for example, the airlines was hyper
successful. But we did the same thing for all their other industries.
So we did the same thing for construction, and then we name dropped the construction
company. We did the same thing for mining.
And I think we got an Anglo American, which is the fourth largest mining company in the world
with just an email, right?
So I'm thinking about how we could sort of leverage that for Despro. What are your thoughts?
Chris Wicker
I don't have any, I don't have any thoughts about it. I mean, I, you know, I'm looking to
supplement what we're doing, and we need to, if we were to partner together, do something and
then pivot as we see things happen, what's working, what's not working, you guys, not only,
you're not the only experts, but you're the expert I'm talking to today.
Jack Bricknell
You're the expert in the selling world, right?
Chris Wicker
So, I would look for that guidance on what do you need to understand, what do you need to
know so that you can build messaging to at least get started, and then we can pivot off of that.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Chris Wicker
And I may be able to give it to you, I may not be able to give it to you.
One of the things that was not happening before the investment, we didn't know, and we just
installed a piece of software in our platform, only on cloud, because we can't get behind, we
can't get to all self hosted because of firewalls.
But we did not. This was a 20-year plus company that was run by a technical co-founder that
wanted to build some really cool software and just have a business, and then he got to a point
where he's like, this thing has so much opportunity, but I don't want to take it there, I want to be
a part of it, so he went out to the market and looked for investment, and that's how we got here,
so we're much more, we're growing and scaling into a proper business that would know some of
those things.
Jack Bricknell
So there may be things you ask me that I have to say are very basic, and I would love to give
you an answer, but I don't have an answer for you.
Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, I totally get that. We get that sometimes. You know, the more statistics
we can be armed with, the better.
That said, if we have, even what I'm looking at right now on my screen with like Airbus, Brown
University, you know, even if there's not necessarily average statistics to mention, if we can
say...
Look, they were having this problem, and this is what we fixed, that kind of messaging can also
work. So, yeah, that's kind of the information that I would aim to collect so that we can make
this, you know, make this work.
What's sort of your goal with this? I know you said to supplement your efforts, but in terms of, I
guess, a number of demos or a number of, you conversations, what would you be looking for?
Chris Wicker
I mean, if I could get 15 to 20 qualified discovery calls, and out of that, let's just use 20 because
it's easier math for percentages.
If I could get 20 qualified discovery meetings, which turned into 10 qualified demos, and five of
those got through the process to actually buy from us, I think that would be a, would be a
success.
Right. Okay. Do an idea of what your commercial structures look like?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, for sure. So we typically do a setup where we're going to try, I think in this use case,
you've got quite a large TAM.
I think we go for probably 2,000 3,000 emails daily. So when you look at that from a monthly
basis, we don't send on weekends.
That's going to be 66,000-ish every month. Now, we typically do a three-email cadence, so
we're going to try to aim to hit around 20,000 different prospects every month.
With email, is kind of a volume game because it's not like LinkedIn. You have naturally a low
response rate.
But I'll walk you through a little bit on the KPIs, and then I'll get to the commercial side in just a
minute.
So, like, if we were to send 66,000 emails, this is on a monthly Our goal is typically to aim for
anywhere on a more narrow campaign, maybe 5% reply rate.
On a more broader campaign, it might be a 3% response rate. So you're looking at 1980
responses. Now, only a small portion of those responses are actual interested responses.
The majority of email responses are always unsubscribe or not interested. It's just the nature of
how it works. But if we're able to get between 3% to 5% of those to then be actual leads,
interested people, 5% is 99 interested responses.
But if I quickly do this, 3% would be about 60 interested responses. Our goal is to take as many
of those interested responses and turn them into actual booked meetings.
And typically, we aim for 50% because we want to squeeze as much as A typical number might
be 25% to 30% of those.
So from a conservative scenario, 3% response rate, 3% of those responses being interested,
you're looking at around about 18 actual discoveries.
And then, of course, from the discovery call, how those metrics go is determined by, you know,
how qualified the lead is and then also your guy's side on the sales side.
ACTION ITEM
Send proposal to Chris for cold email outreach services (3k emails/day, 3-month trial, $9.5k
upfront/$3.3k monthly + $250/meeting)
Okay.
Jack Bricknell
Cool. All right. Let grab. Let's pull something up real quick. So yeah, that would be a 3,000 email
a day setup.
How that typically looks is we do a three month trial. The three month trial is we keep it trying.
Keep it relatively low risk. So what we do is we do 10K as the flat, and that's either paid $9,500
up front or $3,300 a month for the three months split apart, and then we do a pay-per-meeting.
Pay-per-meeting in this case, I would guess we'd probably put it on the lower end simply
because these are kind of much easier prospects to reach.
So we have some clients where they want the CFO of 500 million-plus-a-year companies, and
it's very hard to reach those people.
With this, we could probably do something like $250 per meeting, and that would be the
commercial structure of this.
Chris Wicker
And what if the meeting doesn't show up?
Jack Bricknell
Then you don't pay.
Chris Wicker
And how do we prove that, or how do you track that?
Jack Bricknell
So we set up, we have tracking for all the meetings we book, obviously. It's important for us
getting paid.
And then when you have something that's a no-show, we have a system where You can flag
that, and you're credited on the future.
So we don't do it where we're going to refund you every time because that would be a
nightmare, but we just credit it to future meetings.
Chris Wicker
Sure. Okay. So roughly either $9,500 up for up in three months or $3,300 a month paid monthly,
and then $250 every booked, qualified, interested opportunity.
Jack Bricknell
That's right.
Chris Wicker
Okay. And how long does it take to get started?
Jack Bricknell
So the email infrastructure has a hard need for a two-week warmup. Unfortunately, we can't
really do anything about that.
But what we do do is to get that going, we take about two business days, so we keep that as
short as possible.
And then also during that two-week warmup period is when we do all of the lead list pulling, all
of the campaign messaging, so that right at the end of roughly 16 days, because two days in the
four and 14 days, day.
ACTION ITEM
Review Jack's proposal for cold email outreach services by Fri 4/11
Thank We are ready to go.
Chris Wicker
Okay. All right. Can you get me something in writing?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, I can shoot you a proposal.
Chris Wicker
All right. Why don't we do that at the next step?
ACTION ITEM
Send calendar invite for follow-up meeting Fri 4/11 3pm Central
All righty. Sounds good.
Chris Wicker
And then we'll probably try to reconnect with you by the middle of the week, but for sure by the
end of the week.
Jack Bricknell
Gotcha. Okay. Do you want to put a placeholder on the calendar for, say, next Thursday? Sure.
Chris Wicker
I just know I'm going to have a busier week stateside next week because I'm in London the
week after that with my London team.
Jack Bricknell
Gotcha. That was the 10th.
Chris Wicker
What about just same time, 3 p.m. on Thursday? Central.
Jack Bricknell
3 p.m. Central. 3 p Central. Let me take a look. Central Thursday. 3 p.m. One sec. I have some
not-so-great Wi-Fi at moment.
I could do that on Friday.
Chris Wicker
All right, that's fine.
Jack Bricknell
Okay, perfect. I'll send you the invite for 3 p.m.
Chris Wicker
Central Friday next week. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the info and we'll talk
next week.
Jack Bricknell
When do you think you'll have me over a proposal? Maybe Monday? Monday?
Chris Wicker
yeah. Okay, perfect. I appreciate it.
Jack Bricknell
Sounds good. Nice talking to you, Chris. You too. Bye. Take care. Bye.

4: "Sam Knoll
How are we doing?
Jack Bricknell
Hey, Sam. How are you?
Sam Knoll
I'm good. Sorry about all these note takers, by the way. They don't all need to be in here. They
follow me around.
Jack Bricknell
I've got one as well. You've got two of them. Double the notes.
Sam Knoll
I tell you. I'm not going to miss anything, right? Let me close my door. Hold on one moment. All
right.
Jack Bricknell
So how are you doing? Where are you based?
Sam Knoll
Greensboro. Love no, I'll back. I'm I'm in, my office is in Greensboro.
Jack Bricknell
I live in Durham, North Carolina. Okay. So you're really, you're really close by then because I'm
in Chapel Hill.
Sam Knoll
Oh, okay.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah.
Sam Knoll
Yeah. That makes sense. I knew that. Yeah. My, my wife is a professor. Well, she runs the Mac
program for Keenan Flagler.
Jack Bricknell
Oh, okay.
Sam Knoll
Yeah.
Jack Bricknell
They haven't let me in just yet.
Sam Knoll
I've got to keep working at it now, but hopefully they value, you know, me actually going, going
and doing things.
Uh, yeah.
Jack Bricknell
Anyway, um, what, uh, what got you interested in, uh, and jumping on and talking to me?
Sam Knoll
Uh, just, uh, an interesting, you know, kind of, I don't know. It just looked like something that, uh,
I might be able to work with.
It could, be a benefit either to me or to the business I'm, I'm with.
Jack Bricknell
So yeah.
Sam Knoll
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's really what, like
Jack Bricknell
Got you. You're in charge of marketing, right?
Sam Knoll
I am. I'm one of the people in charge of marketing. You know, it's interesting. There are two of
us who have this same title that I do, and we actually act as kind of virtual or fractional CMOs for
some of our clients.
And for many others, we are simply creating the marketing plan that we then use our team to
carry out for them.
Jack Bricknell
Right. Okay. So you also do marketing for the clients as well.
Sam Knoll
Correct.
Jack Bricknell
Yep. Okay. That's interesting. Your role is both the actual company's marketing and then also
the clients. Gotcha. What types of things do you do right now for Cogent Analytics specifically to
get clients besides, you know, referrals and word of mouth?
Sam Knoll
right. Thank you. Bye. Well, what's interesting with that one is the opposite end, if you go to the
other end of this floor I'm on, is filled with about 70 people who are a phone bank, who are
pulling in prospects every day.
Jack Bricknell
Wow.
Sam Knoll
The way our business works here, those folks come in, they get evaluated, if they sign on, they
work with an analyst for two to three days who then often prescribes that they need to work with
a project manager who will step in for kind of eight to 15, 14, 15 weeks, to really kind of realign
the processes within their business.
During that period, they oftentimes also either determine then or the initial analysts may
determine that they need some help with.
So the bulk of our clients right now are already clients of this company, so to speak. So as I look
at that, it could be feasible that working with you could be an asset for some of my clients.
It also could be an asset for me personally as well as I look at other things that I may work on
outside of this company.
Jack Bricknell
Got it. Okay, that makes sense.
Sam Knoll
Thanks for the overview.
Jack Bricknell
Yep. Cool. Yeah, I read up on a lot of, well, not a crazy amount of them, but I read a few of the
case studies and sort of the results from the website.
And you guys are mostly working with sort of traditional businesses, wholesalers, contractors.
Sam Knoll
Yeah, it's interesting. That website, and this is in the kettle black because it's the same
conversation I have with most of my clients and prospects, but our website is being redone right
now.
If you notice, if you look up the word marketing, there is not a single page on that site for
marketing.
We have no section of the site at this point. We're a newer piece of the whole thing, yet we've
been around since, I think, 2019.
So it's, yeah, that one will be really, really nice once that has grown and we get that new site up,
then it's feasible.
We may actually be properly represented, and all of those case studies need to be updated, but
you're right. Most of our small to medium-sized businesses have a blue-collar-esque element to
them.
We also do work with groups It's like architects, some higher-end engineers, things like that, but
it still has this blue-collar-ish element.
Jack Bricknell
Right. Yeah. Yeah, I see that. I see that, sure. But yeah, it's a good thing you're getting a new
website.
This one looks like it's pretty outdated.
Sam Knoll
It is.
Jack Bricknell
It is.
Sam Knoll
Look, it's very painful for us to tell someone that they need to redo things, and then they look at
our site, and it needs to be redone, you know?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, do as I say, not as I do, right?
Sam Knoll
Exactly.
Jack Bricknell
Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Interesting. Okay. Well, I'll tell you a bit about sort of where I run, and
maybe you'll have some ideas on where it could be helpful for you guys.
Nice. So we do email outreach at scale, which means, you know, emails like the one that you
got, but you know, on a massive scale.
So we do that to get our own clients, of course, but also that is the service we offer to our
clients.
And it's an interesting thing because it can be helpful for so many different industries.
Sam Knoll
Anything that's really B2B, this can be helpful for.
Jack Bricknell
So it could be anything from we've had a commercial cleaning client who was just we wanted to
email all the local businesses and tell them, hey, you know, what are you currently paying for
your space?
Would you be interested in a 30 minute free consultation to see if we could do it for less? Right.
And then also, you know, I've had people that are using it for raising capital. So the biggest thing
I've ever done, which unfortunately I wasn't a licensed broker dealer, I couldn't take a
percentage, but I helped a small group of maybe 10 of them investment bankers.
They were raising 150 million for a. A realty trust, AIP realty trust. And we did an outreach
campaign. They basically gave me, look, here are the types of companies that would be
interested in this.
You can find what the investor mandates are using a software called PitchBook where you can
pull all the data.
So I pulled all the data. We sent out emails, very simple emails. Look, this is the company. This
is what they're offering here.
It's the estimated IRR, all the fancy terms. And we got them a bunch of meetings with industry
investors and they ended up from the meetings that I got them from the email, filling the whole
round, 150 million bucks.
Sam Knoll
Awesome.
Jack Bricknell
So I like to use that example because it can be as simple as a local business doing emails to all
the businesses in the area to something like that, where they're raising 150 million bucks from
email outreach.
Sam Knoll
Very cool. How long have you been doing this? Well, guess, yeah. How long have you been
doing this and how big is your – it sounds like you have a team, quote-unquote, but what can
you tell me about your business side of this?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, so I'll tell you the whole spiel. So I first started about two and half years ago with learning
how to do email outreach.
Before that, had different businesses, but that was – I was 17 in the summertime. And I had
done it – my buddy had told me about this accounting firm that would pay you like a percent of
what business you could drive for them.
And so he invited me, and I taught myself the skill like a bunch of the softwares. And, of course,
when I first started, I wasn't that good.
But in three months, I got them 66 meetings with CEOs and CFOs at American companies
between 20-ish employees to 500 employees on the larger end.
And from those meetings, it came out – it was a specific type of tax credit they were doing, and
they got about $4 million worth of tax credits.
And the accounting firm made $800,000 and paid me a percentage of the revenue that I got
them. I said, well, not bad for just sending some emails.
Sam Knoll
could work.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, exactly. So then I started doing it. For a long time, I kept doing it on commission basis.
And very quickly, I realized that that was not really a sustainable model for running a business.
It's only working on commission. That took me a long – a lot of failures and a lot of really good
results and then ending up getting stiffed.
But then eventually, I built it into like a proper service. I have a team of five people. They're
overseas, so no Americans yet.
But – and, you know, I've been growing it quite rapidly and balancing that with UNC. don't to
see. Let's I'm going
So that, you know, that's where we're at now.
Sam Knoll
What year are you right now?
Jack Bricknell
Freshman.
Sam Knoll
Freshman. Yeah. Cool. Cool, cool. All right. Well, you know, it's interesting. So I'm just trying to
think. How did the dollars work in utilizing your service at this point?
Jack Bricknell
So my structure, I've spoken to a bunch of mentors and they told me you need to raise your
price because I used to do it for not that much.
And honestly, the client wouldn't be that invested. I wouldn't be that invested. It's not it's not
really a good relationship.
So I've been trying to do less clients and more per. So the last six clients that I've onboarded,
we do 10K for a three month trial of the service.
And then after the three month trial, we move to a fixed monthly fee. The very. very.
Sam Knoll
Interesting. Okay. And so, you know, when you, when you're going in short to sell this to
someone, you know, you're explaining, you know, or I guess, how do you justify the 10,000 as
you're, you're discussing this with the prospect then?
Jack Bricknell
So first I do the discovery call where basically I try and figure out, okay, how is this? Genuinely, I
don't take everyone that comes because there are some companies where I just think, I don't
think this will get them a great result.
And so I don't, I'd rather have the client for longer than just be taking people and making quick
10 grand and then, you know, they leave because, you know, I don't actually make a crazy
amount of profit on, on just the 10 grand.
Sam Knoll
Plus you can make some assumptions about their potential targets to, you know, some, I'm sure
some of those you look
And you think, all right, this one, based on what I've done and how I know at least what I have
set up works, this one looks like I have a good potential to pull kind of another, some great
prospects for them.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. So like some, some clients come in and I know I just did this for another software
company that has a bunch of good case studies.
That's really a big thing for me is having these companies. One of the best ways to do this is just
to do a very short email that says, Hey, we just did X, Y, and Z for a company exactly like yours.
So what I'll do is I'll look at, let's say they have 20 previous clients and they just helped
Coca-Cola do whatever.
Maybe I can't name Coca-Cola by name, but I can say we just helped one of the largest
beverage companies increase EB to 5% or whatever.
Would you be interested in seeing how we did it? You take that framework, apply it to all the.
Previous case studies they have, it's every single time I do that, it works, almost every time.
So the difficulty is when they don't have a good track record or really – also, it's what they
charge.
So what do they make per client? I have clients where, for instance, one of our clients does a
negotiation of FedEx and UPS contracts, and they take a percentage of what they save the
client.
So we just got them a client who's spending about $5 million a year on FedEx and UPS, and
they're going to save them around 27% to 29% of that.
I call it a million bucks a year, a million three, I think. They're going to make $300,000 a year for
a period of three years off of that client that I got them.
So for them, paying me $5,000 a month is like, of course I'm going to pay this guy $5,000.
Sam Knoll
Yeah, why not?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, exactly. So it's about what they charge, their track record. And who they're trying to reach.
Sam Knoll
Very interesting. Yeah, so what kind of what pieces do you need or what elements from a
business? I hear the case studies, and that makes perfect sense.
Yeah. Probably some landing pages created as well. What's your process when you're working
with someone then?
Jack Bricknell
So for me, case studies is helpful. Some businesses, case studies, like we're about to onboard
a, this might be more in tune with the kind of clients that you guys have, a mobile installations
company.
So they service transit agencies across the U.S. with new parts on their buses and this kind of
thing. And basically they can do it for cheaper than the equipment manufacturers themselves
because they upsell them on that or whatever.
But for that approach, it's not really a case study thing. It's just, look, likely you're overpaying on
paying the equipment manufacturer itself.
We've been in business 25 years, serviced God knows how many buses. Would you be
interested in just a quick chat to see if you're overpaying for this or not?
Just a quick chat. We're going to do that. We're going to send it to all the transit agency. He's
giving me a list of job titles to hit.
And it's not really a case study approach. So it can work with it without case study. just depends
on the type of business.
Landing pages, I don't need. So we do all that. We build everything. I get the lead scraped. The
things I need essentially is basically a 30 to 60 minute call with the client to really understand
who is it you want to talk to.
You know, geography, uh, which person in New York. The hard part is getting a really good
understanding of their business so that I can condense their whole value proposition into a
three-sentence email.
That's the hard part. But you do it enough times, you can do it.
Sam Knoll
That's the creativity end of what you do. Writing great emails, and I try to explain this to a lot of
clients, is its own science and art.
Anyone can write an email, but to write one that works, the whole other world.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, exactly. And also, we have clients, like I'll have some really corporate clients, and they've
got a whole marketing department.
And the marketing department is sending out these emails that are three paragraphs long and
thinking that some CEO is actually going to take time to read that from someone they've never
even talked to.
So we've got to condense it right down. That's the most important part of it, really.
Sam Knoll
It's probably three paragraphs long. It sounds like it's coming from some big, powerful company
as opposed to someone communicating with them.
Exactly. Totally different world.
Jack Bricknell
Exactly. Yep.
Sam Knoll
Yep.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Exactly.
Sam Knoll
Yeah, I spent seven years working at, I think at the time, was the biggest biotech company in the
world, running one of their divisions, at least all the digital marketing.
They one of their divisions and got the emails they sent out were all fit that way. Yep. And
almost every one that went out was because of an offer.
There was no information that got sent out. They weren't sharing anything.
Jack Bricknell
They weren't building a community. There was none of that taking place. Yeah.
Sam Knoll
It was sad.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the best approach is to just treat it like you're actually writing an email to
another human being.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the best approach. Really, if you want to read the email, if it sounds
like it's a marketing email, then you've done it wrong.
The whole point is to just, I actually personally sat there and wrote this to you, but if you can
automate that at scale and just have that kind of impression, then you'll win.
Sam Knoll
Interesting. All right. Well, this is interesting. You know, I think for my use, some of my clients,
actually most of my clients, this would potentially be a decent fit for, but there are some others
for whom it could be a really nice fit for them, where I know they're I they are trying to bring in
the right prospects and the communication with those prospects is very important.
And, and can be quite targeted to, you know, I mean, I example, I have one client who said, I've
got 40 people I want to do business with, here they are, all in the state of Connecticut, you
know, and we have to figure out how do we pull them in.
He ultimately wants to meet with the CEO of every one of those people, take them to his club
and smoke a cigar and drink bourbon with them and discuss doing work, you know.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sam Knoll
Most others don't hit it that way, but they may be interested in speaking with, here's another
example, a company in the pool industry, like the swimming pool.
Yeah. They want to speak with the manager of every apartment complex within, you know,
they're in Houston, Texas. Yeah.
And so it's within a 70 mile radius around them. It's a tremendous number of them, as well as
the head of every HOA within that area and some other similar things.
Those are the sort of options that I think for whom this could work quite well. Yeah. You know,
bottom line, it's bringing up the problems those people have that they're not even aware of.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. That's that's perfect that that example with the pools, I think it's the perfect
example. That's very similar to what we did with the commercial cleaning company.
Yeah. Which is, you know, just in this area, we want the managers at, you know, the apartment
complex is a great.
But, you know, all these different types of businesses and we can pull a list comes out, let's say,
thousand people, for example, and we just email them.
And when it's that by our standards, it's kind of a small. more. them all. Yeah. So what we'll also
do is LinkedIn outreach to them because you just want to absolutely make sure you get in front
of them.
And the local approach works really well.
Sam Knoll
Yeah, because you listed early on, what are the different techniques you use to reach out?
Jack Bricknell
Obviously email, but what else do you use? Email is definitely the main one. That's where I've
spent 80% of my time because it just works really well.
And it's also one of those things you've got to stay up-to-date with it because Google Outlook,
they're always changing their things.
LinkedIn is the secondary. That's kind of a newer thing probably in the last six months I've
implemented it. And I was honestly pretty blown away because you get a much higher response
rate that you just can't do as much volume.
But that's not, you know, if your whole list is only a thousand people, it's totally doable. And so
what you can do is omni-channel.
Email and LinkedIn. I've done some experimenting with direct mail, but I wouldn't say I'm good
enough to where I'd want to like charge for it.
I'd probably do that at cost just to make sure, you know, that but those two.
Sam Knoll
that's where my expertise is really direct mail is I'll just throw this out is also an interesting one. I
find it all depends who you want to reach and what you're sending them can't look like a
postcard or like a normal letter or, you know, it needs to oftentimes come in what appears to be
a FedEx on quote, even though it's not, you know, it's and then the paper it's printed on is
important and the personalization within that is even more important.
And, and probably a real signature and all these little things.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, they had company point elements they would They would be able to do it so it looks like
it's handwritten, but there are a thousand of them, and that was pretty nifty.
Sam Knoll
Yep, yep. Interesting. All right. Well, what's kind of the next step here in your eyes?
ACTION ITEM
Identify potential use cases for email outreach service (Cogent Analytics + clients). Prepare to
discuss in Friday meeting.
say I think we should get a follow-up call on the books.
Sam Knoll
I got another one in a few minutes.
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, yeah. So we should get a follow-up call on the books. And I guess in between then, if you
want to think about the use cases for Cogen or for the clients, and I would say, you know, we'd
start out with one I think is sensible, and then, you know, try others.
Another thing that's, you know, nifty is if you're doing this for the clients, it could be something
where probably Sure.
Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of a bundle. So we'll try with one, and if everything goes well, then you can
sort of save them a bunch of money by doing it under you guys or however you think about
doing it, where you could bundle it.
Obviously, that's great for us, and it's great for you and great for the clients.
Sam Knoll
Meaning hitting numerous clients under that $10,000 umbrella?
Jack Bricknell
Yeah, so we would figure something out. I think what it would be is we do one, well, depending
on what you're comfortable with, but one where you think this is a great use case for this, and
potentially you could come to me whenever we next meet, sometime next week, and say, here
are the few that I think this could be, and then I can tell you which one I think this would be.
The one we could really nail it.
Sam Knoll
Okay.
Jack Bricknell
And then, you know, we could engage. on that, and then move from there. I think that would be
reasonable next steps wise.
So what, what times are you free next week?
Sam Knoll
Ah, that's a very good question. Let's look here. Next week, and what time are we now?
Jack Bricknell
We did a 2.30 today. Yep.
Sam Knoll
I could probably do like a Thursday, same time next week, how does that sound on your end?
Jack Bricknell
I can't, I can't do that one. I'm pretty open on Wednesdays and Fridays, and Mondays, I'm pretty
open too.
Sam Knoll
What if we do that same time on Friday then?
ACTION ITEM
Send calendar invite for Friday 2:30 PM follow-up call with Sam Knoll.
Friday at 2.30. Yep, that'll, that'll work.
Sam Knoll
I can do that. Okay.
Jack Bricknell
Perfect. Let me just, me just, What Cool. I'll send you an invite for Friday, 2.30 in the afternoon.
Sam Knoll
All right. Awesome. Thank you. Nice meeting you, Sam. Best of luck. Good meeting you. Yeah.
And hopefully this will work out.
That'll be good. Yeah. We'll talk next week. Awesome. Thank you. All righty. Take care. Bye-bye.
Bye.
