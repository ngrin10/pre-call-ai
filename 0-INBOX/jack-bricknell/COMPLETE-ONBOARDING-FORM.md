🔍 Segment Deep-Dive — Describe Your 3-5 Prospect Types

Why this matters:

• Tailored confirmation pages, emails, and SMS convert up to 30 % more when they speak to a prospect’s exact fears and proof triggers.

• Sales-call transcripts give us language; this exercise reveals the gaps transcripts miss because it forces you to think through each buyer’s decision lens.

• Investing five thoughtful minutes here saves weeks of “why are they ghosting?” later.

How to fill it:

1. Think of the 3-5 distinct kinds of people who book calls (roles, budgets, mindsets).

2. For each one, copy the format below and overwrite the placeholders.

3. Bullet answers are fine—honesty beats perfect.
• Name / Nickname:

• 1-sentence pain they blurt out:

• First question they always ask:

• How they found you (first touch point, been following your content for a while, referral, price shopping, etc):

• Other questions they ask (and your quick answers):

• Common misconception about what we do:

• Objection that stalls them:

• If they saw this one proof / success story, they’d buy:

• Urgency level (1 = meh, 5 = “yesterday”):

• Skepticism level (1 = easy believer, 5 = show me receipts):

markdown## Client Knowledge Structure

When working on [client] files:
1. Always check CLIENT-MASTER.md first
2. Reference /01-foundation/ for business context
3. Use /02-discovery/ for nuances and edge cases
4. Pull from /03-transcripts/ for buyer language
5. Check /04-materials/ for brand consistency
6. Log all changes in /05-implementation/
7. Track results in /06-optimization/

## Common Client Complexities

- Multiple brands or offerings
