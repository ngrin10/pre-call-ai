## **Key Improvements Made:**

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Qualification**: Don't waste time on clients without proper data

4. **ðŸ”„ Context Integration**: Every step informed by business strategy
5. **âœ… Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints prevent poor outcomes
6. **ðŸ“ˆ Results Focus**: Clear metrics and timeline from day one
