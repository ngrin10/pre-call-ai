## AWARENESS STAGE CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### How to Define Prospects in Each Awareness Stage for Renoworks Pro:

#### PROBLEM AWARE
These prospects recognize they have challenges but haven't connected them to a specific solution category yet. They experience:

- Frustrated homeowners who can't visualize their remodeling ideas during consultations
- Lost sales due to miscommunication about project outcomes
- Time wasted on multiple design revisions and back-and-forth emails
- Difficulty standing out from competitors who still use traditional sales methods
- Homeowners asking "can you show me what this will actually look like?"

They search for terms like "how to close more remodeling sales," "homeowner keeps changing their mind," or "better way to present home improvement ideas."

#### SOLUTION AWARE
These prospects understand that visualization technology could solve their problems. They know they need:

- A way to show before-and-after visuals during sales presentations
- Digital tools to replace physical samples and catalogs
- Software that helps homeowners make confident decisions faster
- Technology to differentiate their sales process

They're comparing different approaches like hiring designers, using general design software, or finding specialized visualization tools. They search for "home remodeling visualization software," "exterior design tools for contractors," or "sales presentation software for remodelers."

#### PRODUCT AWARE
These prospects specifically know about Renoworks Pro or similar specialized solutions. They:

- Have seen Renoworks Pro demonstrations or marketing materials
- Understand it's an AR/visualization tool specifically for home improvement professionals
- Are evaluating specific features like ease of use, product catalogs, or mobile capabilities
- Consider implementation factors like training, cost, and ROI

They're actively comparing Renoworks Pro against alternatives like:

- **Hover** - Known for its 3D modeling, measurement and estimation features alongside visualization
- **Cedreo** - Popular for interior design visualization
- **Chief Architect** - Professional architectural software with steeper learning curve
- **SketchUp** - General 3D modeling tool that requires more technical skill
- **Generic design apps** - Like Houzz Pro, Home Designer, or even Pinterest boards
- **Manufacturer-specific tools** - Like James Hardie's Home Color Tool or CertainTeed's ColorCoach
- **In-house designers or architects** - Considering hiring specialists vs. using software
- **Traditional methods** - Physical samples, catalogs, or hand-drawn sketches

They search for terms like:
- "Renoworks Pro reviews"
- "Renoworks vs Hover"
- "Best visualization software for contractors"
- "Renoworks Pro pricing"
- "Is Renoworks Pro worth it"
- "Renoworks alternatives"

At this stage, they need clear differentiation on why Renoworks Pro is the better choice for their specific use case - whether that's ease of use for non-technical salespeople, comprehensive product catalogs, mobile functionality, or proven ROI in shortening sales cycles.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

To analyze a specific batch, instruct the orchestrator agent:

"Read the instructions in CLAUDE.md and analyze Batch [X]: Transcripts [Y-Z]"

For example:
- "Read the instructions in CLAUDE.md and analyze Batch 3: Transcripts 21-30"
- "Read the instructions in CLAUDE.md and analyze Batch 7: Transcripts 61-70"

The orchestrator will automatically:
1. Identify the correct 10 transcript files for that batch
2. Launch 10 sub-agents with complete forensic analysis instructions
3. Compile individual analyses maintaining all formatting
4. Synthesize patterns to create segments and nurture strategies
5. Generate all 7 required deliverables
6. Update the master analysis file
