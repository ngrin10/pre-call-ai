# 📊 Client Insights Hub

This folder is the CENTRAL CONSOLIDATION POINT for all client intelligence gathered during onboarding.

## 🎯 Purpose

Instead of having insights scattered across:
- Onboarding form responses
- Discovery call notes
- Email threads
- Random documents

Everything gets consolidated HERE into structured documents that:
1. Automation scripts can read
2. Content generation can reference
3. Team members can quickly understand

## 📁 What Goes Here

### 1. `client-insights-consolidation.md`
The master document that combines:
- **From Onboarding Form**: All structured responses
- **From Discovery Call**: Deep insights and patterns
- **Synthesized Analysis**: B2B/B2C decision, awareness levels

### 2. `competitive-intelligence.md` (if needed)
- Competitor analysis
- Positioning opportunities
- Differentiation strategies

### 3. `buyer-psychology-profile.md` (if needed)
- Detailed buyer personas
- Psychological triggers
- Decision-making patterns

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Step 1: Client fills out ONBOARDING FORM
              ↓
Step 2: You conduct DISCOVERY CALL
              ↓
Step 3: CONSOLIDATE everything here
              ↓
Step 4: AUTOMATION reads from here
              ↓
Step 5: CONTENT gets personalized
```

## 📝 Filling Out the Consolidation

### After Onboarding Form:
1. Copy all responses into Section 1
2. Note any red flags or opportunities
3. Form initial hypotheses

### After Discovery Call:
1. Add deep insights to Section 2
2. Update awareness level estimates
3. Finalize B2B vs B2C classification
4. Note positioning angles

### Before Running Automation:
1. Ensure all sections are complete
2. Double-check B2B/B2C decision
3. Verify awareness percentages
4. Save and close file

## 🤖 Automation Integration

The following scripts read from this folder:
- `deep-research.sh` - Pulls consolidated insights
- `generate-content.sh` - Uses for personalization
- `generate-gamma-assets.sh` - References for visuals

*Think of this as the client's "psychological profile" that makes everything else personalized and effective.*
