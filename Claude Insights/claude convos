## **Seamless Onboarding â†’ Cursor Integration Workflow**

### **1. Updated Cursor Structure for Onboarding Flow**

### **2. The Onboarding â†’ Cursor Flow**

Create this file: `/0-INBOX/README-START-HERE.md`

```markdown
# New Client Onboarding Process

## Step 1: During/After Onboarding Call

1. Copy `/0-INBOX/new-client-template/` folder
2. Rename to client name (e.g., `/0-INBOX/abc-corp/`)
3. Start filling each file AS YOU GET THE INFO

## Step 2: Data Collection Checklist

### File 1: `1-transcripts-raw.md`
```
Total Transcripts: [X]
Source: [Gong/Fathom/Zoom/Doc]

=== TRANSCRIPT 1 ===
Date: 
Outcome:
Rep:
[Paste transcript]

=== TRANSCRIPT 2 ===
[Continue...]
```

### File 2: `2-marketing-materials.md`
```
## VSL/Video Scripts
[Paste transcripts of their videos]

## Case Studies
[Paste their case studies]

## Website Copy
[Key pages copy]

## Current Email Sequences
[Their existing emails if any]
```

### File 3: `3-onboarding-call.md`
```
Date: [Date]
Attendees: [Names]

## Key Points Discussed
- Business model:
- Target avatar:
- Main pain points:
- Competitors mentioned:
- Success metrics:
- Unique mechanism:

## Full Transcript
[Paste onboarding call transcript]
```

### File 4-7: Research Files
[Templates for each research type]

## Step 3: Start Analysis in Cursor

Type this command:
"I have a new client [name] ready for analysis in the inbox. Start the forensic analysis process."

Cursor will automatically:
1. Move files from INBOX â†’ ANALYSIS
2. Begin transcript analysis
3. Incorporate all context
4. Generate segments
```

### **3. Cursor Rules Update for Onboarding**

Add to `.cursor/rules.md`:

```markdown
## New Client Onboarding Process

When user says "new client [name] ready for analysis":

1. Check `/0-INBOX/[client-name]/` for all 7 files
2. Verify completeness:
   - At least 15 transcripts in file 1
   - Marketing materials in file 2
   - Onboarding transcript in file 3
   - Research files 4-7 (can be basic)

3. Create analysis structure:
   ```
   /1-ANALYSIS/[client-name]/
   â”œâ”€â”€ context-summary.md (synthesize files 2-7)
   â”œâ”€â”€ transcript-batches/ (split file 1 into batches of 10)
   â”œâ”€â”€ batch-analyses/
   â””â”€â”€ segment-identification.md
   ```

4. Start forensic analysis using:
   - Primary: Sales transcripts
   - Context: Everything else
   - Output: Clear segments with evidence

## Analysis Integration

When analyzing, ALWAYS reference:
- Onboarding call insights for business context
- Marketing materials for their current messaging
- Research files for market positioning
- Their unique mechanism and differentiators

Weight insights by source:
1. Sales transcripts (highest - actual buyer language)
2. Onboarding call (high - strategic context)
3. Marketing materials (medium - aspirational messaging)
4. Research (supporting - market context)
```

### **4. Onboarding Day Workflow**

Create: `/0-INBOX/onboarding-day-checklist.md`

```markdown
# Onboarding Day Checklist

## During Call
- [ ] Take notes in `3-onboarding-call.md`
- [ ] Record call for transcript
- [ ] Get access to their tools
- [ ] Confirm transcript delivery method

## Immediately After Call (30 min)
- [ ] Create client folder in `/0-INBOX/`
- [ ] Copy template files
- [ ] Add onboarding notes while fresh
- [ ] Send client follow-up with requests

## By End of Day
- [ ] Upload onboarding transcript
- [ ] Add any materials shared during call
- [ ] Do basic company research (15 min)
- [ ] Create Notion entry with status

## Next Day Morning
- [ ] Check if transcripts arrived
- [ ] Begin organizing in Cursor
- [ ] Start analysis if ready
```

### **5. Smart Commands for Smooth Flow**

Add to `/prompts/05-quick-prompts.md`:

```markdown
# Onboarding Integration Commands

## Initial Setup
"Set up new client [name] from onboarding on [date]"
â†’ Creates folder structure and checklist

## Completeness Check
"Check if [client] is ready for analysis"
â†’ Verifies all 7 files have content

## Context Summary
"Create context summary for [client]"
â†’ Synthesizes files 2-7 into single brief

## Begin Analysis
"Start forensic analysis for [client] with full context"
â†’ Runs analysis incorporating ALL materials

## Quick Segment Check
"Based on [client] onboarding call, what segments should I expect?"
â†’ Pre-identifies likely segments from context
```

### **6. The Smooth Integration Process**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Onboarding Call] --> B[Fill 0-INBOX Template]
    B --> C{All 7 Files Ready?}
    C -->|No| D[Gather Missing Info]
    C -->|Yes| E[Run Context Summary]
    E --> F[Begin Transcript Analysis]
    F --> G[Incorporate All Context]
    G --> H[Generate Segments]
    H --> I[Create Content]
    I --> J[Move to Implementation]
    
    D --> C
```

### **7. Context Integration Example**

When you run analysis, Cursor will now do this:

```markdown
"Analyzing ABC Corp transcripts with context:

From Onboarding Call:
- They struggle with show rates (currently 45%)
- Main competitors: XYZ, 123 Corp
- Unique angle: 24/7 support

From Marketing Review:
- Current messaging focuses on price (mistake?)
- Case studies emphasize speed
- No emotional connection in current emails

From Research:
- Industry trend: Moving to value over price
- Avatar wants: Certainty, not savings
- Competitors weak on: Personal touch

Now analyzing transcripts WITH this context..."
```

### **8. File Organization Best Practice**

```bash
# After analysis complete, archive:
/3-ARCHIVE/
â””â”€â”€ /[client-name]/
    â”œâ”€â”€ /original-materials/    # The 7 files
    â”œâ”€â”€ /analysis-history/      # All analysis docs
    â”œâ”€â”€ /final-deliverables/    # What was implemented
    â””â”€â”€ /performance-data/      # Results tracking
```

This system ensures:
- Nothing gets lost between onboarding and analysis
- All context informs the output
- Clear workflow from call to completion
- Easy to track what stage each client is in
- Cursor has access to EVERYTHING when analyzing

The key is that **EVERYTHING flows through the INBOX first**, gets processed in ANALYSIS with full context, then outputs to CONTENT GENERATION. No jumping around, no lost information.
