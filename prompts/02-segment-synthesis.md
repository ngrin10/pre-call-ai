## PROMPT

Synthesize the forensic analysis results from multiple transcript batches into clear, unified awareness segment profiles. Create a comprehensive view of each segment that will drive content creation and automation decisions.

**BATCH ANALYSES PROVIDED**:
[Insert all batch analysis results here - batch-1-results.md, batch-2-results.md, etc.]

**CLIENT CONTEXT**:
[Insert client-brief.md content here]

**TOTAL TRANSCRIPTS ANALYZED**: [Number]
