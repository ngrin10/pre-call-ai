# ðŸš€ Super Simple Guide

## Just Use These Commands:

### ScaleStream Work:
```bash
/scalestream              # Opens ScaleStream helper
./quick new joe-smith     # New client
./quick analyze joe-smith # Analyze transcripts
./quick content joe-smith problem-aware  # Generate content
```

### Code Work:
```bash
/analyze   # Check code health
/improve   # Make code better  
/review    # Review changes
```

## That's It! 

Everything else is automatic:
- âœ… Changes tracked
- âœ… Notifications when done
- âœ… Code checked for errors
- âœ… Progress saved

Just work normally. The system handles the rest! ðŸŽ‰
