# Transcript Batch 1 - FitLife Transformation

## Transcript 1: Sarah M. (Problem Aware)
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Outcome**: No show
**Setter**: Mike

**Key Excerpts**:
"I'm just so frustrated. I've been trying to lose this weight for 3 years now. Nothing works. I do good for a few weeks then I'm right back where I started. Maybe worse."

"I saw your ad about the neuroscience thing and thought maybe there's something different here? I don't know. I've tried Weight Watchers, keto, intermittent fasting... I'm starting to think it's just me."

"How much? Oh... I need to think about it. That's a lot. Let me talk to my husband."

**Awareness Indicators**: Doesn't understand root cause, thinks it's her fault, no urgency

## Transcript 2: Mike R. (Solution Aware)
**Date**: 2024-01-16
**Outcome**: Closed
**Closer**: Jennifer

**Key Excerpts**:
"I know I need accountability. I can't do this on my own anymore. I've been researching different coaching programs. What makes yours different from like, Noom or these other apps?"

"The neuroscience angle is interesting. So you're saying it's not about willpower, it's about rewiring habits? That actually makes sense because I'm successful in my business but I can't crack this health thing."

"I'm comparing a few options. You guys, another coach I found on Instagram, and honestly considering just hiring a local trainer. What kind of support do I actually get for $3k?"

**Awareness Indicators**: Actively comparing, understands need for coaching, wants differentiation

## Transcript 3: Lisa K. (Problem Aware)
**Date**: 2024-01-17
**Outcome**: Rescheduled (then no-showed)
**Setter**: Ashley

**Key Excerpts**:
"I don't even know why I booked this call. I'm probably wasting your time. I've tried everything and nothing works for someone like me. I'm 52, hormones are crazy, metabolism is shot..."

"My doctor says I need to lose 40 pounds. My knees hurt. I'm tired all the time. But every diet I try, I maybe lose 5 pounds then gain back 10. It's like my body fights me."

"A coach? I don't know... what would they even do? Tell me to eat less and move more? I know that already."

**Awareness Indicators**: Skeptical, defeated mindset, doesn't understand coaching value

---

## Transcript 4: David T. (Product Aware)
**Date**: 2024-01-18
**Outcome**: Closed
**Closer**: Tom

**Key Excerpts**:
"I've narrowed it down to you guys and another program called Precision Nutrition. You're both around the same price. Main thing I'm trying to figure out is the time commitment and how the coaching actually works."

"I like that you have the app to track habits. The other program is more email-based. But they include meal plans and you don't? How does that work?"

"My company is actually doing a wellness challenge starting in March. If I start now, would I see results by then? I need to be down at least 15 pounds to have a shot at winning."

**Awareness Indicators**: Specific comparisons, timeline urgency, implementation questions

## Transcript 5: Jennifer S. (Solution Aware)
**Date**: 2024-01-19
**Outcome**: Think about it
**Setter**: Mike

**Key Excerpts**:
"I've been following you on Instagram for like 6 months. I love the content about habit stacking and the brain science stuff. I know I need something like this."

"My biggest fear is signing up and then not following through. I've ghosted two online trainers already. How do you keep people engaged? Especially people like me who travel for work?"

"The price is... it's fine. I spend more than that on stupid stuff. I just need to know I'll actually do it this time. Can I talk to someone who travels a lot like me?"

**Awareness Indicators**: Long nurture time, specific concerns, trust issues from past failures
