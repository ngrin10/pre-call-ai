## 📝 Materials Request Template

```
Subject: Materials needed for your pre-call nurture system

Hi [Name],

To build your custom awareness-based nurture system, I'll need the following materials:

REQUIRED (Must have to proceed):
□ 15+ sales call transcripts with outcomes noted
□ Current email sequences (exported from your platform)
□ Website/sales page copy
□ 3-5 case studies or success stories

HELPFUL (The more the better):
□ SMS templates you currently use
□ Competitor websites/materials
□ Past email performance data
□ A/B test results
□ Current automation workflows

Please organize as follows:
1. Transcripts: Include date, outcome (closed/lost/no-show), and deal size
2. Emails: Export full sequences with subject lines
3. Case studies: Include client name, problem, solution, results

Dropbox/Google Drive links work great, or you can email directly.

Questions? Let me know!
