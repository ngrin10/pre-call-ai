Subject: Transcript Collection Instructions - [Client Name]

Hi [VA Name],

We're helping [Client Name] improve their sales process. We need to analyze their sales calls to understand their buyers better.

**Your task:** Collect 20-25 sales call transcripts from [Fathom/Gong/Client's platform]

I've attached a detailed SOP, but here's the quick version:

1. **Create a Google Doc** titled "[Client Name] - Sales Call Transcripts for Analysis"
2. **Copy full transcripts** from recent sales calls (last 90 days)
3. **Add basic info** for each (date, outcome, quality rating)
4. **Share with me** when done

**Time estimate:** About 1-2 hours total.

**What makes a good transcript:**
âœ… Recent (last 90 days)
âœ… Full conversation (30+ minutes)  
âœ… Mix of won and lost deals
âœ… Prospect talks about their problems

**Access details:**
- Platform: [Gong/Fathom/etc]
- Login: [Credentials or "I'll send separately"]
- Date range focus: [Specific dates if relevant]

**Please complete by:** [Date - usually 2-3 business days]
