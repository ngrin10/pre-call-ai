**WHEN**: Days 3-5  
**WHAT**:

## 💡 **The Magic That Happens Automatically:**

When someone books a call, the system knows which "pizza" they want:

```
🙋 "I've never heard of this" person books
   ↓
🤖 System says: "Oh, you're a BEGINNER!"
   ↓
📧 Sends beginner-friendly emails
   ↓
💬 Sends encouraging texts
   ↓
😊 They show up understanding everything!
```

## 📊 **VA ROI In Simple Math:**

**Without VA:**
- Your time: 3 hours × $200/hour = $600 worth of your time
- Quality: You're tired, might miss good transcripts

**With VA:**
