impact of [problem]. Takes 5 minutes to review: [Gamma Link]
```

### Solution Aware Sequence Integration

what to look for: [Gamma PDF Export]
```

### Product Aware Sequence Integration
```markdown
Email #1: "Your Personalized [Company] Overview"
...
I created a custom presentation based on our conversation.
Review it here before our call: [Gamma Link]
```

## üéØ Customization Points

### 1. **Modify Deck Templates**
Edit functions in `generate-gamma-assets.py`:
- `create_problem_aware_deck()` - Education focus
- `create_solution_aware_deck()` - Comparison focus
- `create_product_aware_deck()` - Sales focus

### 2. **Adjust Visual Styles**
```python
"imageModel": "flux-1-pro",  # or dall-e-3, imagen-3-pro
"imageStyle": "professional business photography",
"themeName": "chisel",  # or clarity, executive, impact
```

### 3. **Control Access Levels**
```python
"workspaceAccess": "view",  # or comment, edit, full_access
"externalAccess": "view",   # or no_access, comment, edit
```

## üîó Advanced Integrations

### 1. **Auto-Attach to Emails**
Modify `generate-content.sh` to include Gamma links:
```bash
# After generating emails, create Gamma assets
./automation/generate-gamma-assets.sh "$CLIENT"

# Parse gamma-assets.json and insert links into emails
```

### 2. **Webhook Integration**
Use Gamma's polling API with webhooks:
```python
# Send generation ID to your webhook
webhook_url = "https://your-app.com/gamma-webhook"
requests.post(webhook_url, json={"id": generation_id})
```

### 3. **CRM Integration**
```python
# After generation, update CRM
crm_api.update_contact(
    contact_id,
    custom_fields={
        "problem_aware_deck": results['problem_aware_deck']['docUrl'],
        "solution_aware_deck": results['solution_aware_deck']['docUrl']
    }
)
```

## üìä Metrics to Track

### Engagement Metrics
- Deck view rates vs email open rates
- Time spent viewing decks
- Slide completion rates
- Download rates for PDFs

### Conversion Impact
- Show rate improvement with decks
- Close rate for prospects who viewed decks
- Which deck type drives most engagement

## üö® Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
```bash
# Test your API key
curl -X GET https://api.gamma.app/public-api/v0.1/test \
  -H "X-API-KEY: sk-gamma-your-key"
```

### Generation Timeouts
- Decks with many images take longer
- Use `"skipImageGeneration": true` for faster generation
- Images will load when deck is opened

### Rate Limits
- Max 100 presentations per day
- Space out bulk generations
- Consider upgrading for higher limits

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. **Timing in Nurture Sequence**

- Product Aware: Include in pre-call email

### 2. **Personalization**
- Use prospect's industry in titles
- Reference their specific pain points
- Include relevant case studies

### 3. **Follow-Up**
- Track deck engagement in CRM
- Trigger follow-up based on viewing behavior
- Reference specific slides in calls
